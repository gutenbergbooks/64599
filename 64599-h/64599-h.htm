<h3><a name="chap01"></a>I</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I dare say I can find the child, if you would like to see
him,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent said; she had a fluttering wish to assent to every
suggestion made by her visitor, whom she regarded as a high and rather terrible
personage. To look for the little boy she came out of her small parlour, which
she had been ashamed to exhibit in so untidy a state, with paper
&lsquo;patterns&rsquo; lying about on the furniture and snippings of stuff
scattered over the carpet&mdash;she came out of this somewhat stuffy sanctuary,
dedicated at once to social intercourse and to the ingenious art to which her
life had been devoted, and, opening the house-door, turned her eyes up and down
the little street. It would presently be tea-time, and she knew that at that
solemn hour Hyacinth narrowed the circle of his wanderings. She was anxious and
impatient, and in a fever of excitement and complacency, not wanting to keep
Mrs Bowerbank waiting, though she sat there, heavily and consideringly, as if
she meant to stay; and wondering not a little whether the object of her quest
would have a dirty face. Mrs Bowerbank had intimated so definitely that she
thought it remarkable on Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s part to have taken care of him
gratuitously for so many years, that the humble dressmaker, whose imagination
took flights about every one but herself, and who had never been conscious of
an exemplary benevolence, suddenly aspired to appear, throughout, as devoted to
the child as she had struck her solemn, substantial guest as being, and felt
how much she should like him to come in fresh and frank, and looking as pretty
as he sometimes did. Miss Pynsent, who blinked confusedly as she surveyed the
outer prospect, was very much flushed, partly with the agitation of what Mrs
Bowerbank had told her, and partly because, when she offered that lady a drop
of something refreshing, at the end of so long an expedition, she had said she
couldn&rsquo;t think of touching anything unless Miss Pynsent would keep her
company. The cheffonier (as Amanda was always careful to call it), beside the
fireplace, yielded up a small bottle which had formerly contained
eau-de-cologne and which now exhibited half a pint of a rich gold-coloured
liquid. Miss Pynsent was very delicate; she lived on tea and watercress, and
she kept the little bottle in the cheffonier only for great emergencies. She
didn&rsquo;t like hot brandy and water, with a lump or two of sugar, but she
partook of half a tumbler on the present occasion, which was of a highly
exceptional kind. At this time of day the boy was often planted in front of the
little sweet-shop on the other side of the street, an establishment where
periodical literature, as well as tough toffy and hard lollipops, was
dispensed, and where song-books and pictorial sheets were attractively
exhibited in the small-paned, dirty window. He used to stand there for half an
hour at a time, spelling out the first page of the romances in the <i>Family
Herald</i> and the <i>London Journal</i>, and admiring the obligatory
illustration in which the noble characters (they were always of the highest
birth) were presented to the carnal eye. When he had a penny he spent only a
fraction of it on stale sugar-candy; with the remaining halfpenny he always
bought a ballad, with a vivid woodcut at the top. Now, however, he was not at
his post of contemplation; nor was he visible anywhere to Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s
impatient glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Millicent Henning, tell me quickly, have you seen my child?&rdquo; These
words were addressed by Miss Pynsent to a little girl who sat on the doorstep
of the adjacent house, nursing a dingy doll, and who had an extraordinary
luxuriance of dark brown hair, surmounted by a torn straw hat. Miss Pynsent
pronounced her name Enning.
</p>

<p>
The child looked up from her dandling and patting, and after a stare of which
the blankness was somewhat exaggerated, replied: &ldquo;Law no, Miss Pynsent, I
never see him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you always messing about with him, you naughty little
girl?&rdquo; the dressmaker returned, with sharpness. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he
round the corner, playing marbles, or&mdash;or some jumping game?&rdquo; Miss
Pynsent went on, trying to be suggestive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure <i>you</i>, he never plays nothing,&rdquo; said Millicent
Henning, with a mature manner which she bore out by adding, &ldquo;And I
don&rsquo;t know why I should be called naughty, neither.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you want to be called good, please go and find him and tell him
there&rsquo;s a lady here come on purpose to see him, this very instant.&rdquo;
Miss Pynsent waited a moment, to see if her injunction would be obeyed, but she
got no satisfaction beyond another gaze of deliberation, which made her feel
that the child&rsquo;s perversity was as great as the beauty, somewhat soiled
and dimmed, of her insolent little face. She turned back into the house, with
an exclamation of despair, and as soon as she had disappeared Millicent Henning
sprang erect and began to race down the street in the direction of another,
which crossed it. I take no unfair advantage of the innocence of childhood in
saying that the motive of this young lady&rsquo;s flight was not a desire to be
agreeable to Miss Pynsent, but an extreme curiosity on the subject of the
visitor who wanted to see Hyacinth Robinson. She wished to participate, if only
in imagination, in the interview that might take place, and she was moved also
by a quick revival of friendly feeling for the boy, from whom she had parted
only half an hour before with considerable asperity. She was not a very
clinging little creature, and there was no one in her own domestic circle to
whom she was much attached; but she liked to kiss Hyacinth when he didn&rsquo;t
push her away and tell her she was tiresome. It was in this action and epithet
he had indulged half an hour ago; but she had reflected rapidly (while she
stared at Miss Pynsent) that this was the worst he had ever done. Millicent
Henning was only eight years of age, but she knew there was worse in the world
than that.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bowerbank, in a leisurely, roundabout way, wandered off to her sister, Mrs
Chipperfield, whom she had come into that part of the world to see, and the
whole history of the dropsical tendencies of whose husband, an undertaker with
a business that had been a blessing because you could always count on it, she
unfolded to Miss Pynsent between the sips of a second glass. She was a
high-shouldered, towering woman, and suggested squareness as well as a
pervasion of the upper air, so that Amanda reflected that she must be very
difficult to fit, and had a sinking at the idea of the number of pins she would
take. Her sister had nine children and she herself had seven, the eldest of
whom she left in charge of the others when she went to her service. She was on
duty at the prison only during the day; she had to be there at seven in the
morning, but she got her evenings at home, quite regular and comfortable. Miss
Pynsent thought it wonderful she could talk of comfort in such a life as that,
but could easily imagine she should be glad to get away at night, for at that
time the place must be much more terrible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you frightened of them&mdash;ever?&rdquo; she inquired,
looking up at her visitor with her little heated face.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bowerbank was very slow, and considered her so long before replying, that
she felt herself to be, in an alarming degree, in the eye of the law; for who
could be more closely connected with the administration of justice than a
female turnkey, especially so big and majestic a one? &ldquo;I expect they are
more frightened of me,&rdquo; she replied at last; and it was an idea into
which Miss Pynsent could easily enter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And at night I suppose they rave, quite awful,&rdquo; the little
dressmaker suggested, feeling vaguely that prisons and madhouses came very much
to the same.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if they do, we hush &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank remarked,
rather portentously; while Miss Pynsent fidgeted to the door again, without
results, to see if the child had become visible. She observed to her guest that
she couldn&rsquo;t call it anything but contrary that he should not turn up,
when he knew so well, most days in the week, when his tea was ready. To which
Mrs Bowerbank rejoined, fixing her companion again with the steady orb of
justice, &ldquo;And do he have his tea, that way, by himself, like a little
gentleman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I try to give it to him tidy-like, at a suitable hour,&rdquo; said
Miss Pynsent, guiltily. &ldquo;And there might be some who would say that, for
the matter of that, he <i>is</i> a little gentleman,&rdquo; she added, with an
effort at mitigation which, as she immediately became conscious, only involved
her more deeply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are people silly enough to say anything. If it&rsquo;s your
parents that settle your station, the child hasn&rsquo;t much to be thankful
for,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank went on, in the manner of a woman accustomed to
looking facts in the face.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent was very timid, but she adored the aristocracy, and there were
elements in the boy&rsquo;s life which she was not prepared to sacrifice even
to a person who represented such a possibility of grating bolts and clanking
chains. &ldquo;I suppose we oughtn&rsquo;t to forget that his father was very
high,&rdquo; she suggested, appealingly, with her hands clasped tightly in her
lap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His father? Who knows who <i>he</i> was? He doesn&rsquo;t set up for
having a father, does he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, surely, wasn&rsquo;t it proved that Lord Frederick&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear woman, nothing was proved except that she stabbed his lordship
in the back with a very long knife, that he died of the blow, and that she got
the full sentence. What does such a piece as that know about fathers? The less
said about the poor child&rsquo;s ancestors the better!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This view of the case caused Miss Pynsent fairly to gasp, for it pushed over
with a touch a certain tall imaginative structure which she had been piling up
for years. Even as she heard it crash around her she couldn&rsquo;t forbear the
attempt to save at least some of the material.
&ldquo;Really&mdash;really,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;she never had to do with
any one but the nobility!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bowerbank surveyed her hostess with an expressionless eye. &ldquo;My dear
young lady, what does a respectable little body like you, that sits all day
with her needle and scissors, know about the doings of a wicked low foreigner
that carries a knife? I was there when she came in, and I know to what she had
sunk. Her conversation was choice, I assure you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very dreadful, and of course I know nothing in
particular,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent quavered. &ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t low when
I worked at the same place with her, and she often told me she would do nothing
for any one that wasn&rsquo;t at the very top.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She might have talked to you of something that would have done you both
more good,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank remarked, while the dressmaker felt rebuked in
the past as well as in the present. &ldquo;At the very top, poor thing! Well,
she&rsquo;s at the very bottom now. If she wasn&rsquo;t low when she worked,
it&rsquo;s a pity she didn&rsquo;t stick to her work; and as for pride of
birth, that&rsquo;s an article I recommend your young friend to leave to
others. You had better believe what I say, because I&rsquo;m a woman of the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Indeed she was, as Miss Pynsent felt, to whom all this was very terrible,
letting in the cold light of the penal system on a dear, dim little theory. She
had cared for the child because maternity was in her nature, and this was the
only manner in which fortune had put it in her path to become a mother. She had
as few belongings as the baby, and it had seemed to her that he would add to
her importance in the little world of Lomax Place (if she kept it a secret how
she came by him), quite in the proportion in which she should contribute to his
maintenance. Her weakness and loneliness went out to his, and in the course of
time this united desolation was peopled by the dressmaker&rsquo;s romantic mind
with a hundred consoling evocations. The boy proved neither a dunce nor a
reprobate; but what endeared him to her most was her conviction that he
belonged, &lsquo;by the left hand&rsquo;, as she had read in a novel, to an
ancient and exalted race, the list of whose representatives and the record of
whose alliances she had once (when she took home some work and was made to
wait, alone, in a lady&rsquo;s boudoir) had the opportunity of reading in a fat
red book, eagerly and tremblingly consulted. She bent her head before Mrs
Bowerbank&rsquo;s overwhelming logic, but she felt in her heart that she
shouldn&rsquo;t give the child up for all that, that she believed in him still,
and that she recognised, as distinctly as she revered, the quality of her
betters. To believe in Hyacinth, for Miss Pynsent, was to believe that he
<i>was</i> the son of the extremely immoral Lord Frederick. She had, from his
earliest age, made him feel that there was a grandeur in his past, and as Mrs
Bowerbank would be sure not to approve of such aberrations Miss Pynsent prayed
she might not question her on that part of the business. It was not that, when
it was necessary, the little dressmaker had any scruple about using the arts of
prevarication; she was a kind and innocent creature, but she told fibs as
freely as she invented trimmings. She had, however, not yet been questioned by
an emissary of the law, and her heart beat faster when Mrs Bowerbank said to
her, in deep tones, with an effect of abruptness, &ldquo;And pray, Miss
Pynsent, does the child know it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Know about Lord Frederick?&rdquo; Miss Pynsent palpitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bother Lord Frederick! Know about his mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t say that. I have never told him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But has any one else told him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To this inquiry Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s answer was more prompt and more proud; it
was with an agreeable sense of having conducted herself with extraordinary
wisdom and propriety that she replied, &ldquo;How could any one know? I have
never breathed it to a creature!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bowerbank gave utterance to no commendation; she only put down her empty
glass and wiped her large mouth with much thoroughness and deliberation. Then
she said, as if it were as cheerful an idea as, in the premises, she was
capable of expressing, &ldquo;Ah, well, there&rsquo;ll be plenty, later on, to
give him all information!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I pray God he may live and die without knowing it!&rdquo; Miss Pynsent
cried, with eagerness.
</p>

<p>
Her companion gazed at her with a kind of professional patience. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t keep your ideas together. How can he go to her, then, if he&rsquo;s
never to know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, did you mean she would tell him?&rdquo; Miss Pynsent responded,
plaintively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him! He won&rsquo;t need to be told, once she gets hold of him and
gives him&mdash;what she told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What she told you?&rdquo; Miss Pynsent repeated, open-eyed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The kiss her lips have been famished for, for years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, poor desolate woman!&rdquo; the little dressmaker murmured, with her
pity gushing up again. &ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll see she&rsquo;s fond of
him,&rdquo; she pursued, simply. Then she added, with an inspiration more
brilliant, &ldquo;We might tell him she&rsquo;s his aunt!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may tell him she&rsquo;s his grandmother, if you like. But
it&rsquo;s all in the family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, on that side,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, musingly and irrepressibly.
&ldquo;And will she speak French?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;In that case he
won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, a child will understand its own mother, whatever she speaks,&rdquo;
Mrs Bowerbank returned, declining to administer a superficial comfort. But she
subjoined, opening the door for escape from a prospect which bristled with
dangers, &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s just according to your own conscience.
You needn&rsquo;t bring the child at all, unless you like. There&rsquo;s many a
one that wouldn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no compulsion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And would nothing be done to me, if I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; poor Miss
Pynsent asked, unable to rid herself of the impression that it was somehow the
arm of the law that was stretched out to touch her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing that could happen to you would be that <i>he</i> might
throw it up against you later,&rdquo; the lady from the prison observed, with a
gloomy impartiality.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, if he were to know that I had kept him back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;d be sure to know, one of these days. We see a great deal
of that&mdash;the way things come out,&rdquo; said Mrs Bowerbank, whose view of
life seemed to abound in cheerless contingencies. &ldquo;You must remember that
it is her dying wish, and that you may have it on your conscience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a thing I <i>never</i> could abide!&rdquo; the little
dressmaker exclaimed, with great emphasis and a visible shiver; after which she
picked up various scattered remnants of muslin and cut paper and began to roll
them together with a desperate and mechanical haste. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
awful, to know what to do&mdash;if you are very sure she <i>is</i>
dying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean she&rsquo;s shamming? we have plenty of that&mdash;but we
know how to treat &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, I suppose so,&rdquo; murmured Miss Pynsent; while her visitor went
on to say that the unfortunate person on whose behalf she had undertaken this
solemn pilgrimage might live a week and might live a fortnight, but if she
lived a month, would violate (as Mrs Bowerbank might express herself) every
established law of nature, being reduced to skin and bone, with nothing left of
her but the main desire to see her child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re afraid of her talking, it isn&rsquo;t much she&rsquo;d
be able to say. And we shouldn&rsquo;t allow you more than about eight
minutes,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank pursued, in a tone that seemed to refer itself to
an iron discipline.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shouldn&rsquo;t want more; that would be enough to last
me many a year,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, accommodatingly. And then she added,
with another illumination, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he might throw it up
against me that I <i>did</i> take him? People might tell him about her in later
years; but if he hadn&rsquo;t seen her he wouldn&rsquo;t be obliged to believe
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bowerbank considered this a moment, as if it were rather a super-subtle
argument, and then answered, quite in the spirit of her official pessimism,
&ldquo;There is one thing you may be sure of: whatever you decide to do, as
soon as ever he grows up he will make you wish you had done the
opposite.&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank called it oppo<i>site</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, then, I&rsquo;m glad it will be a long time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will be ever so long, if once he gets it into his head! At any rate,
you must do as you think best. Only, if you come, you mustn&rsquo;t come when
it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too impossible to decide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs Bowerbank, with superior consistency. And
she seemed more placidly grim than ever when she remarked, gathering up her
loosened shawl, that she was much obliged to Miss Pynsent for her civility, and
had been quite freshened up: her visit had so completely deprived her hostess
of that sort of calm. Miss Pynsent gave the fullest expression to her
perplexity in the supreme exclamation&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you could only wait and see the child, I&rsquo;m sure it would help
you to judge!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear woman, I don&rsquo;t want to judge&mdash;it&rsquo;s none of our
business!&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank exclaimed; and she had no sooner uttered the
words than the door of the room creaked open and a small boy stood there gazing
at her. Her eyes rested on him a moment, and then, most unexpectedly, she gave
an inconsequent cry. &ldquo;Is that the child? Oh, Lord o&rsquo; mercy,
don&rsquo;t take <i>him!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> he shrinking and sensitive?&rdquo; demanded Miss
Pynsent, who had pounced upon him, and, holding him an instant at arm&rsquo;s
length, appealed eagerly to her visitor. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he delicate and
high-bred, and wouldn&rsquo;t he be thrown into a state?&rdquo; Delicate as he
might be the little dressmaker shook him smartly for his naughtiness in being
out of the way when he was wanted, and brought him to the big, square-faced,
deep-voiced lady who took up, as it were, all that side of the room. But Mrs
Bowerbank laid no hand upon him; she only dropped her gaze from a tremendous
height, and her forbearance seemed a tribute to that fragility of constitution
on which Miss Pynsent desired to insist, just as her continued gravity was an
implication that this scrupulous woman might well not know what to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak to the lady nicely, and tell her you are very sorry to have kept
her waiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child hesitated a moment, while he reciprocated Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s
inspection, and then he said, with a strange, cool, conscious indifference
(Miss Pynsent instantly recognised it as his aristocratic manner), &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think she can have been in a very great hurry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was irony in the words, for it is a remarkable fact that even at the age
of ten Hyacinth Robinson was ironical; but the subject of his allusion, who was
not nimble withal, appeared not to interpret it; so that she rejoined only by
remarking, over his head, to Miss Pynsent, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very face of
her over again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of <i>her?</i> But what do you say to Lord Frederick?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>have</i> seen lords that wasn&rsquo;t so dainty!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent had seen very few lords, but she entered, with a passionate
thrill, into this generalisation; controlling herself, however, for she
remembered the child was tremendously sharp, sufficiently to declare, in an
edifying tone, that he would look more like what he ought to if his face were a
little cleaner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was probably Millicent Henning dirtied my face, when she kissed
me,&rdquo; the boy announced, with slow gravity, looking all the while at Mrs
Bowerbank. He exhibited not a symptom of shyness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Millicent Henning is a very bad little girl; she&rsquo;ll come to no
good,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, with familiar decision, and also, considering
that the young lady in question had been her effective messenger, with marked
ingratitude.
</p>

<p>
Against this qualification the child instantly protested. &ldquo;Why is she
bad? I don&rsquo;t think she is bad; I like her very much.&rdquo; It came over
him that he had too hastily shifted to her shoulders the responsibility of his
unseemly appearance, and he wished to make up to her for that betrayal. He
dimly felt that nothing but that particular accusation could have pushed him to
it, for he hated people who were not fresh, who had smutches and streaks.
Millicent Henning generally had two or three, which she borrowed from her doll,
into whom she was always rubbing her nose and whose dinginess was contagious.
It was quite inevitable she should have left her mark under his own nose when
she claimed her reward for coming to tell him about the lady who wanted him.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent held the boy against her knee, trying to present him so that Mrs
Bowerbank should agree with her about his having the air of race. He was
exceedingly diminutive, even for his years, and though his appearance was not
positively sickly it seemed written in his attenuated little person that he
would never be either tall or strong. His dark blue eyes were separated by a
wide interval, which increased the fairness and sweetness of his face, and his
abundant curly hair, which grew thick and long, had the golden brownness
predestined to elicit exclamations of delight from ladies when they take the
inventory of a child. His features were smooth and pretty; his head was set
upon a slim little neck; his expression, grave and clear, showed a quick
perception as well as a great credulity; and he was altogether, in his innocent
smallness, a refined and interesting figure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s one that would be sure to remember,&rdquo; said Mrs
Bowerbank, mentally contrasting him with the undeveloped members of her own
brood, who had never been retentive of anything but the halfpence which they
occasionally contrived to filch from her. Her eyes descended to the details of
his toilet: the careful mending of his short breeches and his long, coloured
stockings, which she was in a position to appreciate, as well as the knot of
bright ribbon which the dressmaker had passed into his collar, slightly
crumpled by Miss Henning&rsquo;s embrace. Of course Miss Pynsent had only one
to look after, but her visitor was obliged to recognise that she had the
highest standard in respect to buttons. &ldquo;And you <i>do</i> turn him out
so it&rsquo;s a pleasure,&rdquo; she went on, noting the ingenious patches in
the child&rsquo;s shoes, which, to her mind, were repaired for all the world
like those of a little nobleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re very civil,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, in a
state of severe exaltation. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a needle but mine has
come near him. That&rsquo;s exactly what I think: the impression would go so
deep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you want to see me only to look at me?&rdquo; Hyacinth inquired, with
a candour which, though unstudied, had again much of the force of satire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very kind of the lady to notice you at
all!&rdquo; cried his protectress, giving him an ineffectual jerk.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no bigger than a flea; there are many that wouldn&rsquo;t
spy you out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find he&rsquo;s big enough, I expect, when he begins to
go,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank remarked, tranquilly; and she added that now she saw
how he was turned out she couldn&rsquo;t but feel that the other side was to be
considered. In her effort to be discreet, on account of his being present (and
so precociously attentive), she became slightly enigmatical; but Miss Pynsent
gathered her meaning, which was that it was very true the child would take
everything in and keep it: but at the same time it was precisely his being so
attractive that made it a kind of sin not to gratify the poor woman, who, if
she knew what he looked like to-day, wouldn&rsquo;t forgive his adoptive mamma
for not producing him. &ldquo;Certainly, in her place, I should go off easier
if I had seen them curls,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank declared, with a flight of
maternal imagination which brought her to her feet, while Miss Pynsent felt
that she was leaving her dreadfully ploughed up, and without any really
fertilising seed having been sown. The little dressmaker packed the child
upstairs to tidy himself for his tea, and while she accompanied her visitor to
the door told her that if she would have a little more patience with her she
would think a day or two longer what was best and write to her when she should
have decided. Mrs Bowerbank continued to move in a realm superior to poor Miss
Pynsent&rsquo;s vacillations and timidities, and her impartiality gave her
hostess a high idea of her respectability; but the way was a little smoothed
when, after Amanda had moaned once more, on the threshold, helplessly and
irrelevantly, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a pity she&rsquo;s so bad?&rdquo; the
ponderous lady from the prison rejoined, in those tones which seemed meant to
resound through corridors of stone, &ldquo;I assure you there&rsquo;s a many
that&rsquo;s much worse!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap02"></a>II</h3>

<p>
Miss Pynsent, when she found herself alone, felt that she was really quite
upside down; for the event that had just occurred had never entered into her
calculations: the very nature of the case had seemed to preclude it. All she
knew, and all she wished to know, was that in one of the dreadful institutions
constructed for such purposes her quondam comrade was serving out the sentence
that had been substituted for the other (the unspeakable horror) almost when
the halter was already round her neck. As there was no question of <i>that</i>
concession being stretched any further, poor Florentine seemed only a little
more dead than other people, having no decent tombstone to mark the place where
she lay. Miss Pynsent had therefore never thought of her dying again; she had
no idea to what prison she had been committed on being removed from Newgate
(she wished to keep her mind a blank about the matter, in the interest of the
child), and it could not occur to her that out of such silence and darkness a
second voice would reach her, especially a voice that she should really have to
listen to. Miss Pynsent would have said, before Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s visit,
that she had no account to render to any one; that she had taken up the child
(who might have starved in the gutter) out of charity, and had brought him up,
poor and precarious as her own subsistence had been, without a penny&rsquo;s
help from another source; that the mother had forfeited every right and title;
and that this had been understood between them&mdash;if anything, in so
dreadful an hour, could have been said to be understood&mdash;when she went to
see her at Newgate (that terrible episode, nine years before, overshadowed all
Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s other memories): went to see her because Florentine had
sent for her (a name, face and address coming up out of the still recent but
sharply separated past of their working-girl years) as the one friend to whom
she could appeal with some chance of a pitying answer. The effect of violent
emotion, with Miss Pynsent, was not to make her sit with idle hands or fidget
about to no purpose; under its influence, on the contrary, she threw herself
into little jobs, as a fugitive takes to by-paths, and clipped and cut, and
stitched and basted, as if she were running a race with hysterics. And while
her hands, her scissors, her needle flew, an infinite succession of fantastic
possibilities trotted through her confused little head; she had a furious
imagination, and the act of reflection, in her mind, was always a panorama of
figures and scenes. She had had her picture of the future, painted in rather
rosy hues, hung up before her now for a good many years; but it seemed to her
that Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s heavy hand had suddenly punched a hole in the
canvas. It must be added, however, that if Amanda&rsquo;s thoughts were apt to
be bewildering visions they sometimes led her to make up her mind, and on this
particular September evening she arrived at a momentous decision. What she made
up her mind to was to take advice, and in pursuance of this view she rushed
downstairs, and, jerking Hyacinth away from his simple but unfinished repast,
packed him across the street to tell Mr Vetch (if he had not yet started for
the theatre) that she begged he would come in to see her when he came home that
night, as she had something very particular she wished to say to him. It
didn&rsquo;t matter if he should be very late, he could come in at any
hour&mdash;he would see her light in the window&mdash;and he would do her a
real mercy. Miss Pynsent knew it would be of no use for her to go to bed; she
felt as if she should never close her eyes again. Mr Vetch was her most
distinguished friend; she had an immense appreciation of his cleverness and
knowledge of the world, as well as of the purity of his taste in matters of
conduct and opinion; and she had already consulted him about Hyacinth&rsquo;s
education. The boy needed no urging to go on such an errand, for he, too, had
his ideas about the little fiddler, the second violin in the orchestra of the
Bloomsbury Theatre. Mr Vetch had once obtained for the pair an order for two
seats at a pantomime, and for Hyacinth the impression of that ecstatic evening
had consecrated him, placed him for ever in the golden glow of the footlights.
There were things in life of which, even at the age of ten, it was a conviction
of the boy&rsquo;s that it would be his fate never to see enough, and one of
them was the wonder-world illuminated by those playhouse lamps. But there would
be chances, perhaps, if one didn&rsquo;t lose sight of Mr Vetch; he might open
the door again; he was a privileged, magical mortal, who went to the play every
night.
</p>

<p>
He came in to see Miss Pynsent about midnight; as soon as she heard the lame
tinkle of the bell she went to the door to let him in. He was an original, in
the fullest sense of the word: a lonely, disappointed, embittered, cynical
little man, whose musical organisation had been sterile, who had the nerves,
the sensibilities, of a gentleman, and whose fate had condemned him, for the
last ten years, to play a fiddle at a second-rate theatre for a few shillings a
week. He had ideas of his own about everything, and they were not always very
improving. For Amanda Pynsent he represented art, literature (the literature of
the play-bill) and philosophy, and she always felt about him as if he belonged
to a higher social sphere, though his earnings were hardly greater than her own
and he lived in a single back-room, in a house where she had never seen a
window washed. He had, for her, the glamour of reduced gentility and fallen
fortunes; she was conscious that he spoke a different language (though she
couldn&rsquo;t have said in what the difference consisted) from the other
members of her humble, almost suburban circle; and the shape of his hands was
distinctly aristocratic. (Miss Pynsent, as I have intimated, was immensely
preoccupied with that element in life.) Mr Vetch displeased her only by one of
the facets of his character&mdash;his blasphemous republican, radical views,
and the contemptuous manner in which he expressed himself about the nobility.
On that ground he worried her extremely, though he never seemed to her so
clever as when he horrified her most. These dreadful theories (expressed so
brilliantly that, really, they might have been dangerous if Miss Pynsent had
not known her own place so well) constituted no presumption against his refined
origin; they were explained, rather, to a certain extent, by a just resentment
at finding himself excluded from his proper place. Mr Vetch was short, fat and
bald, though he was not much older than Miss Pynsent, who was not much older
than some people who called themselves forty-five; he always went to the
theatre in evening-dress, with a flower in his button-hole, and wore a glass in
one eye. He looked placid and genial, and as if he would fidget at the most
about the &lsquo;get up&rsquo; of his linen; you would have thought him finical
but superficial, and never have suspected that he was a revolutionist, or even
a critic of life. Sometimes, when he could get away from the theatre early
enough, he went with a pianist, a friend of his, to play dance-music at small
parties; and after such expeditions he was particularly cynical and startling;
he indulged in diatribes against the British middle-class, its Philistinism,
its snobbery. He seldom had much conversation with Miss Pynsent without telling
her that she had the intellectual outlook of a caterpillar; but this was his
privilege after a friendship now of seven years&rsquo; standing, which had
begun (the year after he came to live in Lomax Place) with her going over to
nurse him, on learning from the milk-woman that he was alone at Number
17&mdash;laid up with an attack of gastritis. He always compared her to an
insect or a bird, and she didn&rsquo;t mind, because she knew he liked her, and
she herself liked all winged creatures. How indeed could she complain, after
hearing him call the Queen a superannuated form and the Archbishop of
Canterbury a grotesque superstition?
</p>

<p>
He laid his violin-case on the table, which was covered with a confusion of
fashion-plates and pincushions, and glanced toward the fire, where a kettle was
gently hissing. Miss Pynsent, who had put it on half an hour before, read his
glance, and reflected with complacency that Mrs Bowerbank had not absolutely
drained the little bottle in the <i>cheffonier</i>. She placed it on the table
again, this time with a single glass, and told her visitor that, as a great
exception, he might light his pipe. In fact, she always made the exception, and
he always replied to the gracious speech by inquiring whether she supposed the
greengrocers&rsquo; wives, the butchers&rsquo; daughters, for whom she worked,
had fine enough noses to smell, in the garments she sent home, the fumes of his
tobacco. He knew her &lsquo;connection&rsquo; was confined to small
shopkeepers, but she didn&rsquo;t wish others to know it, and would have liked
them to believe it was important that the poor little stuffs she made up (into
very queer fashions, I am afraid) should not surprise the feminine nostril. But
it had always been impossible to impose on Mr Vetch; he guessed the truth, the
untrimmed truth, about everything in a moment. She was sure he would do so now,
in regard to this solemn question which had come up about Hyacinth; he would
see that though she was agreeably flurried at finding herself whirled in the
last eddies of a case that had been so celebrated in its day, her secret wish
was to shirk her duty (if it <i>was</i> a duty): to keep the child from ever
knowing his mother&rsquo;s unmentionable history, the shame that attached to
his origin, the opportunity she had had of letting him see the wretched woman
before she died. She knew Mr Vetch would read her troubled thoughts, but she
hoped he would say they were natural and just; she reflected that as he took an
interest in Hyacinth he wouldn&rsquo;t desire him to be subjected to a
mortification that might rankle for ever and perhaps even crush him to the
earth. She related Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s visit, while he sat upon the sofa in
the very place where that majestic woman had reposed, and puffed his
smoke-wreaths into the dusky little room. He knew the story of the
child&rsquo;s birth, had known it years before, so she had no startling
revelation to make. He was not in the least agitated at learning that
Florentine was dying in prison and had managed to get a message conveyed to
Amanda; he thought this so much in the usual course that he said to Miss
Pynsent, &ldquo;Did you expect her to live on there for ever, working out her
terrible sentence, just to spare you the annoyance of a dilemma, or any
reminder of her miserable existence, which you have preferred to forget?&rdquo;
That was just the sort of question Mr Vetch was sure to ask, and he inquired,
further, of his dismayed hostess, whether she were sure her friend&rsquo;s
message (he called the unhappy creature her friend) had come to her in the
regular way. The warders, surely, had no authority to introduce visitors to
their captives; and was it a question of her going off to the prison on the
sole authority of Mrs Bowerbank? The little dressmaker explained that this lady
had merely come to sound her, Florentine had begged so hard. She had been in
Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s ward before her removal to the infirmary, where she now
lay ebbing away, and she had communicated her desire to the Catholic chaplain,
who had undertaken that some satisfaction&mdash;of inquiry, at
least&mdash;should be given her. He had thought it best to ascertain first
whether the person in charge of the child would be willing to bring him, such a
course being perfectly optional, and he had some talk with Mrs Bowerbank on the
subject, in which it was agreed between them that if she would approach Miss
Pynsent and explain to her the situation, leaving her to do what she thought
best, he would answer for it that the consent of the governor of the prison
should be given to the interview. Miss Pynsent had lived for fourteen years in
Lomax Place, and Florentine had never forgotten that this was her address at
the time she came to her at Newgate (before her dreadful sentence had been
commuted), and promised, in an outgush of pity for one whom she had known in
the days of her honesty and brightness, that she would save the child, rescue
it from the workhouse and the streets, keep it from the fate that had swallowed
up the mother. Mrs Bowerbank had a half-holiday, and a sister living also in
the north of London, to whom she had been for some time intending a visit; so
that after her domestic duty had been performed it had been possible for her to
drop in on Miss Pynsent in a natural, casual way and put the case before her.
It would be just as she might be disposed to view it. She was to think it over
a day or two, but not long, because the woman was so ill, and then write to Mrs
Bowerbank, at the prison. If she should consent, Mrs Bowerbank would tell the
chaplain, and the chaplain would obtain the order from the governor and send it
to Lomax Place; after which Amanda would immediately set out with her
unconscious victim. But should she&mdash;<i>must</i> she&mdash;consent? That
was the terrible, the heart-shaking question, with which Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s
unaided wisdom had been unable to grapple.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, he isn&rsquo;t hers any more&mdash;he&rsquo;s mine, mine
only, and mine always. I should like to know if all I have done for him
doesn&rsquo;t make him so!&rdquo; It was in this manner that Amanda Pynsent
delivered herself, while she plied her needle, faster than ever, in a piece of
stuff that was pinned to her knee.
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch watched her awhile, blowing silently at his pipe, with his head thrown
back on the high, stiff, old-fashioned sofa, and his little legs crossed under
him like a Turk&rsquo;s. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true you have done a good deal for
him. You are a good little woman, my dear Pinnie, after all.&rdquo; He said
&lsquo;after all&rsquo;, because that was a part of his tone. In reality he had
never had a moment&rsquo;s doubt that she was the best little woman in the
north of London.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have done what I could, and I don&rsquo;t want no fuss made about it.
Only it does make a difference when you come to look at it&mdash;about taking
him off to see another woman. And <i>such</i> another woman&mdash;and in such a
place! I think it&rsquo;s hardly right to take an innocent child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that; there are people that would tell you it
would do him good. If he didn&rsquo;t like the place as a child, he would take
more care to keep out of it later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, Mr Vetch, how can you think? And him such a perfect little
gentleman!&rdquo; Miss Pynsent cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it you that have made him one?&rdquo; the fiddler asked. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t run in the family, you&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Family? what do you know about that?&rdquo; she replied, quickly,
catching at her dearest, her only hobby.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, what does any one know? what did she know herself?&rdquo;
And then Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s visitor added, irrelevantly, &ldquo;Why should
you have taken him on your back? Why did you want to be so good? No one else
thinks it necessary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be good. That is, I do want to, of course, in a
general way: but that wasn&rsquo;t the reason then. But I had nothing of my
own&mdash;I had nothing in the world but my thimble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would have seemed to most people a reason for not adopting a
prostitute&rsquo;s bastard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I went to see him at the place where he was (just where she had
left him, with the woman of the house), and I saw what kind of a shop
<i>that</i> was, and felt it was a shame an innocent child should grow up in
such a place.&rdquo; Miss Pynsent defended herself as earnestly as if her
inconsistency had been of a criminal cast. &ldquo;And he wouldn&rsquo;t have
grown up, neither. <i>They</i> wouldn&rsquo;t have troubled themselves long
with a helpless baby. <i>They&rsquo;d</i> have played some trick on him, if it
was only to send him to the workhouse. Besides, I always was fond of tiny
creatures, and I have been fond of this one,&rdquo; she went on, speaking as if
with a consciousness, on her own part, of almost heroic proportions. &ldquo;He
was in my way the first two or three years, and it was a good deal of a pull to
look after the business and him together. But now he&rsquo;s like the
business&mdash;he seems to go of himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if he flourishes as the business flourishes, you can just enjoy your
peace of mind,&rdquo; said the fiddler, still with his manner of making a small
dry joke of everything.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but it doesn&rsquo;t close my eyes to that
poor woman lying there and moaning just for the touch of his little &rsquo;and
before she passes away. Mrs Bowerbank says she believes I will bring
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who believes? Mrs Bowerbank?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s anything in life holy enough for you to take
it seriously,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent rejoined, snapping off a thread, with temper.
&ldquo;The day you stop laughing I should like to be there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So long as you are there, I shall never stop. What is it you want me to
advise you? to take the child, or to leave the mother to groan herself
out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to tell me whether he&rsquo;ll curse me when he grows
older.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That depends upon what you do. However, he will probably do it in either
case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that, because you like him,&rdquo; said Amanda,
with acuteness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely; and he&rsquo;ll curse me too. He&rsquo;ll curse every one. He
won&rsquo;t be happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you think I bring him up,&rdquo; the little
dressmaker remarked, with dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t bring him up; he brings you up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you have always said; but you don&rsquo;t know. If you
mean that he does as he likes, then he ought to be happy. It ain&rsquo;t kind
of you to say he won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent added, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would say anything you like, if what I say would help the matter.
He&rsquo;s a thin-skinned, morbid, mooning little beggar, with a good deal of
imagination and not much perseverance, who will expect a good deal more of life
than he will find in it. That&rsquo;s why he won&rsquo;t be happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent listened to this description of her <i>protégé</i> with an
appearance of criticising it mentally; but in reality she didn&rsquo;t know
what &lsquo;morbid&rsquo; meant, and didn&rsquo;t like to ask.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the cleverest person I know, except yourself,&rdquo; she said
in a moment, for Mr Vetch&rsquo;s words had been in the key of what she thought
most remarkable in him. What that was she would have been unable to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much for putting me first,&rdquo; the fiddler rejoined,
after a series of puffs. &ldquo;The youngster is interesting, one sees that he
has a mind, and in that respect he is&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say unique, but
peculiar. I shall watch him with curiosity, to see what he grows into. But I
shall always be glad that I&rsquo;m a selfish brute of a bachelor; that I never
invested in that class of goods.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> comforting. You would spoil him more than I
do,&rdquo; said Amanda.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly, but it would be in a different way. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell him
every three minutes that his father was a duke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A duke I never mentioned!&rdquo; the little dressmaker cried, with
eagerness. &ldquo;I never specified any rank, nor said a word about any one in
particular. I never so much as insinuated the name of his lordship. But I may
have said that if the truth was to be found out, he might be proved to be
connected&mdash;in the way of cousinship, or something of the kind&mdash;with
the highest in the land. I should have thought myself wanting if I hadn&rsquo;t
given him a glimpse of that. But there is one thing I have always
added&mdash;that the truth never <i>is</i> found out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are still more comforting than I!&rdquo; Mr Vetch exclaimed. He
continued to watch her, with his charitable, round-faced smile, and then he
said, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do what I say; so what is the use of my telling
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure you I will, if you say you believe it&rsquo;s the only
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I often say anything so asinine? Right&mdash;right? what have you to
do with that? If you want the only right, you are very particular.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, then, what am I to go by?&rdquo; the dressmaker asked,
bewildered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are to go by this, by what will take the youngster down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take him down, my poor little pet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your poor little pet thinks himself the flower of creation. I
don&rsquo;t say there is any harm in that: a fine, blooming, odoriferous
conceit is a natural appendage of youth and cleverness. I don&rsquo;t say there
is any great harm in it, but if you want a guide as to how you are to treat a
boy, that&rsquo;s as good a guide as any other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want me to arrange the interview, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything but give me another sip of brandy.
I just say this: that I think it&rsquo;s a great gain, early in life, to know
the worst; then we don&rsquo;t live in a fool&rsquo;s paradise. I did that till
I was nearly forty; then I woke up and found I was in Lomax Place.&rdquo;
Whenever Mr Vetch said anything that could be construed as a reference to a
former position which had had elements of distinction, Miss Pynsent observed a
respectful, a tasteful, silence, and that is why she did not challenge him now,
though she wanted very much to say that Hyacinth was no more
&lsquo;presumptuous&rsquo; (that was the term she should have used) than he had
reason to be, with his genteel figure and his wonderful intelligence; and that
as for thinking himself a &lsquo;flower&rsquo; of any kind, he knew but too
well that he lived in a small black-faced house, miles away from the West End,
rented by a poor little woman who took lodgers, and who, as they were of such a
class that they were not always to be depended upon to settle her weekly
account, had a strain to make two ends meet, in spite of the sign between her
windows&mdash;

<p>
Singularly enough, her companion, before she had permitted herself to
interpose, took up her own thought (in one of its parts) and remarked that
perhaps she would say of the child that he was, so far as his actual
circumstances were concerned, low enough down in the world, without one&rsquo;s
wanting him to be any lower. &ldquo;But by the time he&rsquo;s twenty,
he&rsquo;ll persuade himself that Lomax Place was a bad dream, that your
lodgers and your dressmaking were as imaginary as they are vulgar, and that
when an old friend came to see you late at night it was not your amiable
practice to make him a glass of brandy and water. He&rsquo;ll teach himself to
forget all this: he&rsquo;ll have a way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean he&rsquo;ll forget <i>me</i>, he&rsquo;ll deny me?&rdquo;
cried Miss Pynsent, stopping the movement of her needle, short off, for the
first time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As the person designated in that attractive blazonry on the outside of
your house, decidedly he will; and me, equally, as a bald-headed, pot-bellied
fiddler, who regarded you as the most graceful and refined of his acquaintance.
I don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;ll disown you and pretend he never knew you: I
don&rsquo;t think he will ever be such an odious little cad as that; he
probably won&rsquo;t be a sneak, and he strikes me as having some love, and
possibly even some gratitude, in him. But he will, in his imagination (and that
will always persuade him), subject you to some extraordinary metamorphosis; he
will dress you up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll dress me up!&rdquo; Amanda ejaculated, quite ceasing to
follow the train of Mr Vetch&rsquo;s demonstration. &ldquo;Do you mean that
he&rsquo;ll have the property&mdash;that his relations will take him up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, delightful, idiotic Pinnie, I am speaking in a figurative
manner. I don&rsquo;t pretend to say what his precise position will be when we
are relegated; but I affirm that relegation will be our fate. Therefore
don&rsquo;t stuff him with any more illusions than are necessary to keep him
alive; he will be sure to pick up enough on the way. On the contrary, give him
a good stiff dose of the truth at the start.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, dear me, of course you see much further into it than I could
ever do,&rdquo; Pinnie murmured, as she threaded a needle.
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch paused a minute, but apparently not out of deference to this amiable
interruption. He went on suddenly, with a ring of feeling in his voice.
&ldquo;Let him know, because it will be useful to him later, the state of the
account between society and himself; he can then conduct himself accordingly.
If he is the illegitimate child of a French good-for-naught who murdered one of
her numerous lovers, don&rsquo;t shuffle out of sight so important a fact. I
regard that as a most valuable origin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, Mr Vetch, how you talk!&rdquo; cried Miss Pynsent, staring.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what one would think, to hear you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, my dear lady, and for this reason: that those are the people
with whom society has to count. It hasn&rsquo;t with you and me.&rdquo; Miss
Pynsent gave a sigh which might have meant either that she was well aware of
that, or that Mr Vetch had a terrible way of enlarging a subject, especially
when it was already too big for her; and her philosophic visitor went on:
&ldquo;Poor little devil, let him see her, let him see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if later, when he&rsquo;s twenty, he says to me that if I
hadn&rsquo;t meddled in it he need never have known, he need never have had
that shame, pray what am I to say to him then? That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t
get out my head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can say to him that a young man who is sorry for having gone to his
mother when, in her last hours, she lay groaning for him on a pallet in a
penitentiary, deserves more than the sharpest pang he can possibly feel.&rdquo;
And the little fiddler, getting up, went over to the fireplace and shook out
the ashes of his pipe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I am sure it&rsquo;s natural he should feel badly,&rdquo; said
Miss Pynsent, folding up her work with the same desperate quickness that had
animated her throughout the evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least objection to his feeling badly; that&rsquo;s
not the worst thing in the world! If a few more people felt badly, in this
sodden, stolid, stupid race of ours, the world would wake up to an idea or two,
and we should see the beginning of the dance. It&rsquo;s the dull acceptance,
the absence of reflection, the impenetrable density.&rdquo; Here Mr Vetch
stopped short; his hostess stood before him with eyes of entreaty, with clasped
hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Anastasius Vetch, don&rsquo;t go off into them dreadful wild
theories!&rdquo; she cried, always ungrammatical when she was strongly moved.
&ldquo;You always fly away over the house-tops. I thought you liked him
better&mdash;the dear little unfortunate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Anastasius Vetch had pocketed his pipe; he put on his hat with the freedom of
old acquaintance and of Lomax Place, and took up his small coffin-like
fiddle-case. &ldquo;My good Pinnie, I don&rsquo;t think you understand a word I
say. It&rsquo;s no use talking&mdash;do as you like!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I must say I don&rsquo;t think it was worth your coming in at
midnight only to tell me that. I don&rsquo;t like anything&mdash;I hate the
whole dreadful business!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He bent over, in his short plumpness, to kiss her hand, as he had seen people
do on the stage. &ldquo;My dear friend, we have different ideas, and I never
shall succeed in driving mine into your head. It&rsquo;s because I <i>am</i>
fond of him, poor little devil; but you will never understand that. I want him
to know everything, and especially the worst&mdash;the worst, as I have said.
If I were in his position, I shouldn&rsquo;t thank you for trying to make a
fool of me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fool of you? as if I thought of anything but his
&rsquo;appiness!&rdquo; Amanda Pynsent exclaimed. She stood looking at him, but
following her own reflections; she had given up the attempt to enter into his
whims. She remembered, what she had noticed before, in other occurrences, that
his reasons were always more extraordinary than his behaviour itself; if you
only considered his life you wouldn&rsquo;t have thought him so fanciful.
&ldquo;Very likely I think too much of that,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;She wants
him and cries for him: that&rsquo;s what keeps coming back to me.&rdquo; She
took up her lamp to light Mr Vetch to the door (for the dim luminary in the
passage had long since been extinguished), and before he left the house he
turned, suddenly, stopping short, and said, his composed face taking a strange
expression from the quizzical glimmer of his little round eyes&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does it matter after all, and why do you worry? What difference can
it make what happens&mdash;on either side&mdash;to such low people?&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap03"></a>III</h3>

<p>
Mrs Bowerbank had let her know she would meet her, almost at the threshold of
the dreadful place; and this thought had sustained Miss Pynsent in her long and
devious journey, performed partly on foot, partly in a succession of omnibuses.
She had had ideas about a cab, but she decided to reserve the cab for the
return, as then, very likely, she should be so shaken with emotion, so
overpoweringly affected, that it would be a comfort to escape from observation.
She had no confidence that if once she passed the door of the prison she should
ever be restored to liberty and her customers; it seemed to her an adventure as
dangerous as it was dismal, and she was immensely touched by the clear-faced
eagerness of the child at her side, who strained forward as brightly as he had
done on another occasion, still celebrated in Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s industrious
annals, a certain sultry Saturday in August, when she had taken him to the
Tower. It had been a terrible question with her, when once she made up her
mind, what she should tell him about the nature of their errand. She determined
to tell him as little as possible, to say only that she was going to see a poor
woman who was in prison on account of a crime she had committed years before,
and who had sent for her, and caused her to be told at the same time that if
there was any child she could see&mdash;as children (if they were good) were
bright and cheering&mdash;it would make her very happy that such a little
visitor should come as well. It was very difficult, with Hyacinth, to make
reservations or mysteries; he wanted to know everything about everything, and
he projected the light of a hundred questions upon Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s
incarcerated friend. She had to admit that she had been her friend (for where
else was the obligation to go to see her?); but she spoke of the acquaintance
as if it were of the slightest (it had survived in the memory of the prisoner
only because every one else&mdash;the world was so very hard!&mdash;had turned
away from her), and she congratulated herself on a happy inspiration when she
represented the crime for which such a penalty had been exacted as the theft of
a gold watch, in a moment of irresistible temptation. The woman had had a
wicked husband, who maltreated and deserted her, and she was very poor, almost
starving, dreadfully pressed. Hyacinth listened to her history with absorbed
attention, and then he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And hadn&rsquo;t she any children&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t she a little
boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This inquiry seemed to Miss Pynsent a portent of future embarrassments, but she
met it as bravely as she could, and replied that she believed the wretched
victim of the law had had (once upon a time) a very small baby, but she was
afraid she had completely lost sight of it. He must know they didn&rsquo;t
allow babies in prisons. To this Hyacinth rejoined that of course they would
allow him, because he was&mdash;really&mdash;big. Miss Pynsent fortified
herself with the memory of her other pilgrimage, to Newgate, upwards of ten
years before; she had escaped from that ordeal, and had even had the comfort of
knowing that in its fruits the interview had been beneficent. The
responsibility, however, was much greater now, and, after all, it was not on
her own account she was in a nervous tremor, but on that of the urchin over
whom the shadow of the house of shame might cast itself.
</p>

<p>
They made the last part of their approach on foot, having got themselves
deposited as near as possible to the river and keeping beside it (according to
advice elicited by Miss Pynsent, on the way, in a dozen confidential interviews
with policemen, conductors of omnibuses, and small shopkeepers), till they came
to a big, dark building with towers, which they would know as soon as they
looked at it. They knew it, in fact, soon enough, when they saw it lift its
dusky mass from the bank of the Thames, lying there and sprawling over the
whole neighbourhood, with brown, bare, windowless walls, ugly, truncated
pinnacles, and a character unspeakably sad and stern. It looked very sinister
and wicked, to Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s eyes, and she wondered why a prison should
have such an evil face if it was erected in the interest of justice and
order&mdash;an expression of the righteous forces of society. This particular
penitentiary struck her as about as bad and wrong as those who were in it; it
threw a blight over the whole place and made the river look foul and poisonous,
and the opposite bank, with its protrusion of long-necked chimneys, unsightly
gasometers and deposits of rubbish, wear the aspect of a region at whose
expense the jail had been populated. She looked up at the dull, closed gates,
tightening her grasp of Hyacinth&rsquo;s small hand; and if it was hard to
believe anything so blind and deaf and closely fastened would relax itself to
let her in, there was a dreadful premonitory sinking of the heart attached to
the idea of its taking the same trouble to let her out. As she hung back,
murmuring vague ejaculations, at the very goal of her journey, an incident
occurred which fanned all her scruples and reluctances into life again. The
child suddenly jerked his hand out of her own, and placing it behind him, in
the clutch of the other, said to her respectfully but resolutely, while he
planted himself at a considerable distance&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neither do I like it, my darling,&rdquo; cried the dressmaker,
pitifully. &ldquo;Oh, if you knew how little!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we will go away. I won&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She would have embraced this proposition with alacrity if it had not become
very vivid to her while she stood there, in the midst of her shrinking, that
behind those sullen walls the mother who bore him was even then counting the
minutes. She was alive, in that huge, dark tomb, and it seemed to Miss Pynsent
that they had already entered into relation with her. They were near her, and
she knew it; in a few minutes she would taste the cup of the only mercy (except
the reprieve from hanging!) she had known since her fall. A few, a very few
minutes would do it, and it seemed to Miss Pynsent that if she should fail of
her charity now the watches of the night, in Lomax Place, would be haunted with
remorse&mdash;perhaps even with something worse. There was something inside
that waited and listened, something that would burst, with an awful sound, a
shriek, or a curse, if she were to lead the boy away. She looked into his pale
face for a moment, perfectly conscious that it would be vain for her to take
the tone of command; besides, that would have seemed to her shocking. She had
another inspiration, and she said to him in a manner in which she had had
occasion to speak before&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The reason why we have come is only to be kind. If we are kind we
shan&rsquo;t mind its being disagreeable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should we be kind, if she&rsquo;s a bad woman?&rdquo; Hyacinth
inquired. &ldquo;She must be very low; I don&rsquo;t want to know her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; groaned poor Amanda, edging toward him with clasped
hands. &ldquo;She is not bad now; it has all been washed away&mdash;it has been
expiated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s expiated?&rdquo; asked the child, while she almost kneeled
down in the dust, catching him to her bosom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s when you have suffered terribly&mdash;suffered so much that
it has made you good again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has <i>she</i> suffered very much?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For years and years. And now she is dying. It proves she is very good
now, that she should want to see us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean because <i>we</i> are good?&rdquo; Hyacinth went on, probing
the matter in a way that made his companion quiver, and gazing away from her,
very seriously, across the river, at the dreary waste of Battersea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall be good if we are pitiful, if we make an effort,&rdquo; said
the dressmaker, seeming to look up at him rather than down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if she is dying? I don&rsquo;t want to see any one die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent was bewildered, but she rejoined, desperately, &ldquo;If we go to
her, perhaps she won&rsquo;t. Maybe we shall save her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He transferred his remarkable little eyes&mdash;eyes which always appeared to
her to belong to a person older than herself, to her face; and then he
inquired, &ldquo;Why should I save her, if I don&rsquo;t like her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she likes you, that will be enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Miss Pynsent began to see that he was moved. &ldquo;Will she like me
very much?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More, much more than any one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More than you, now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Amanda quickly, &ldquo;I mean more than she likes any
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had slipped his hands into the pockets of his scanty knickerbockers,
and, with his legs slightly apart, he looked from his companion back to the
immense dreary jail. A great deal, to Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s sense, depended on
that moment. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
step in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Deary, deary!&rdquo; the dressmaker murmured to herself, as they crossed
the bare semicircle which separated the gateway from the unfrequented street.
She exerted herself to pull the bell, which seemed to her terribly big and
stiff, and while she waited, again, for the consequences of this effort, the
boy broke out, abruptly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can she like me so much if she doesn&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent wished the gate would open before an answer to this question
should become imperative, but the people within were a long time arriving, and
their delay gave Hyacinth an opportunity to repeat it. So the dressmaker
rejoined, seizing the first pretext that came into her head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
because the little baby she had, of old, was also named Hyacinth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer reason,&rdquo; the boy murmured, staring across
again at the Battersea shore.
</p>

<p>
A moment afterwards they found themselves in a vast interior dimness, with a
grinding of keys and bolts going on behind them. Hereupon Miss Pynsent gave
herself up to an overruling providence, and she remembered, later, no
circumstance of what happened to her until the great person of Mrs Bowerbank
loomed before her in the narrowness of a strange, dark corridor. She only had a
confused impression of being surrounded with high black walls, whose inner face
was more dreadful than the other, the one that overlooked the river; of passing
through gray, stony courts, in some of which dreadful figures, scarcely female,
in hideous brown, misfitting uniforms and perfect frights of hoods, were
marching round in a circle; of squeezing up steep, unlighted staircases at the
heels of a woman who had taken possession of her at the first stage, and who
made incomprehensible remarks to other women, of lumpish aspect, as she saw
them erect themselves, suddenly and spectrally, with dowdy untied bonnets, in
uncanny corners and recesses of the draughty labyrinth. If the place had seemed
cruel to the poor little dressmaker outside, it may be believed that it did not
strike her as an abode of mercy while she pursued her tortuous way into the
circular shafts of cells, where she had an opportunity of looking at captives
through grated peepholes and of edging past others who had temporarily been
turned into the corridors&mdash;silent women, with fixed eyes, who flattened
themselves against the stone walls at the brush of the visitor&rsquo;s dress
and whom Miss Pynsent was afraid to glance at. She never had felt so immured,
so made sure of; there were walls within walls and galleries on top of
galleries; even the daylight lost its colour, and you couldn&rsquo;t imagine
what o&rsquo;clock it was. Mrs Bowerbank appeared to have failed her, and that
made her feel worse; a panic seized her, as she went, in regard to the child.
On him, too, the horror of the place would have fallen, and she had a sickening
prevision that he would have convulsions after they got home. It was a most
improper place to have brought him, no matter who had sent for him and no
matter who was dying. The stillness would terrify him, she was sure&mdash;the
penitential dumbness of the clustered or isolated women. She clasped his hand
more tightly, and she felt him keep close to her, without speaking a word. At
last, in an open doorway, darkened by her ample person, Mrs Bowerbank revealed
herself, and Miss Pynsent thought it (afterwards) a sign of her place and power
that she should not condescend to apologise for not having appeared till that
moment, or to explain why she had not met the bewildered pilgrims near the
principal entrance, according to her promise. Miss Pynsent could not embrace
the state of mind of people who didn&rsquo;t apologise, though she vaguely
envied and admired it, she herself spending much of her time in making excuses
for obnoxious acts she had not committed. Mrs Bowerbank, however, was not
arrogant, she was only massive and muscular; and after she had taken her
timorous friends in tow the dressmaker was able to comfort herself with the
reflection that even so masterful a woman couldn&rsquo;t inflict anything
gratuitously disagreeable on a person who had made her visit in Lomax Place
pass off so pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
It was on the outskirts of the infirmary that she had been hovering, and it was
into certain dismal chambers dedicated to sick criminals, that she presently
ushered her companions. These chambers were naked and grated, like all the rest
of the place, and caused Miss Pynsent to say to herself that it must be a
blessing to be ill in such a hole, because you couldn&rsquo;t possibly pick up
again, and then your case was simple. Such simplification, however, had for the
moment been offered to very few of Florentine&rsquo;s fellow-sufferers, for
only three of the small, stiff beds were occupied&mdash;occupied by white-faced
women in tight, sordid caps, on whom, in the stale, ugly room, the sallow light
itself seemed to rest without pity. Mrs Bowerbank discreetly paid no attention
whatever to Hyacinth; she only said to Miss Pynsent, with her hoarse
distinctness, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her very low; she wouldn&rsquo;t have
waited another day.&rdquo; And she guided them, through a still further door,
to the smallest room of all, where there were but three beds, placed in a row.
Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s frightened eyes rather faltered than inquired, but she
became aware that a woman was lying on the middle bed, and that her face was
turned toward the door. Mrs Bowerbank led the way straight up to her, and,
giving a business-like pat to her pillow, looked invitation and encouragement
to the visitors, who clung together not far within the threshold. Their
conductress reminded them that very few minutes were allowed them, and that
they had better not dawdle them away; whereupon, as the boy still hung back,
the little dressmaker advanced alone, looking at the sick woman with what
courage she could muster. It seemed to her that she was approaching a perfect
stranger, so completely had nine years of prison transformed Florentine. She
felt, immediately, that it was a mercy she hadn&rsquo;t told Hyacinth she was
pretty (as she used to be), for there was no beauty left in the hollow,
bloodless mask that presented itself without a movement. She <i>had</i> told
him that the poor woman was good, but she didn&rsquo;t look so, nor, evidently,
was he struck with it as he stared back at her across the interval he declined
to traverse, kept (at the same time) from retreating by her strange, fixed
eyes, the only portion of all her wasted person in which there was still any
appearance of life. She looked unnatural to Amanda Pynsent, and terribly old; a
speechless, motionless creature, dazed and stupid, whereas Florentine Vivier,
in the obliterated past, had been her idea of personal, as distinguished from
social, brilliancy. Above all she seemed disfigured and ugly, cruelly
misrepresented by her coarse cap and short, rough hair. Amanda, as she stood
beside her, thought with a sort of scared elation that Hyacinth would never
guess that a person in whom there was so little trace of smartness&mdash;or of
cleverness of any kind&mdash;was his mother. At the very most it might occur to
him, as Mrs Bowerbank had suggested, that she was his grandmother. Mrs
Bowerbank seated herself on the further bed, with folded hands, like a
monumental timekeeper, and remarked, in the manner of one speaking from a sense
of duty, that the poor thing wouldn&rsquo;t get much good of the child unless
he showed more confidence. This observation was evidently lost upon the boy; he
was too intensely absorbed in watching the prisoner. A chair had been placed at
the head of her bed, and Miss Pynsent sat down without her appearing to notice
it. In a moment, however, she lifted her hand a little, pushing it out from
under the coverlet, and the dressmaker laid her own hand softly upon it. This
gesture elicited no response, but after a little, still gazing at the boy,
Florentine murmured, in words no one present was in a position to
understand&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Dieu de Dieu, qu&rsquo;il est beau!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t speak nothing but French since she has been so
bad&mdash;you can&rsquo;t get a natural word out of her,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank
said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It used to be so pretty when she spoke English&mdash;and so very
amusing,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent ventured to announce, with a feeble attempt to
brighten up the scene. &ldquo;I suppose she has forgotten it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She may well have forgotten it&mdash;she never gave her tongue much
exercise. There was little enough trouble to keep <i>her</i> from
chattering,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank rejoined, giving a twitch to the
prisoner&rsquo;s counterpane. Miss Pynsent settled it a little on the other
side and considered, in the same train, that this separation of language was
indeed a mercy; for how could it ever come into her small companion&rsquo;s
head that he was the offspring of a person who couldn&rsquo;t so much as say
good morning to him? She felt, at the same time, that the scene might have been
somewhat less painful if they had been able to communicate with the object of
their compassion. As it was, they had too much the air of having been brought
together simply to look at each other, and there was a grewsome awkwardness in
that, considering the delicacy of Florentine&rsquo;s position. Not, indeed,
that she looked much at her old comrade; it was as if she were conscious of
Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s being there, and would have been glad to thank her for
it&mdash;glad even to examine her for her own sake, and see what change, for
her, too, the horrible years had brought, but felt, more than this, that she
had but the thinnest pulse of energy left and that not a moment that could
still be of use to her was too much to take in her child. She took him in with
all the glazed entreaty of her eyes, quite giving up his poor little
protectress, who evidently would have to take her gratitude for granted.
Hyacinth, on his side, after some moments of embarrassing silence&mdash;there
was nothing audible but Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s breathing&mdash;had satisfied
himself, and he turned about to look for a place of patience while Miss Pynsent
should finish her business, which as yet made so little show. He appeared to
wish not to leave the room altogether, as that would be a confession of a
vanquished spirit, but to take some attitude that should express his complete
disapproval of the unpleasant situation. He was not in sympathy, and he could
not have made it more clear than by the way he presently went and placed
himself on a low stool, in a corner, near the door by which they had entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Est-il possible, mon Dieu, qu&rsquo;il soit gentil comme
ça?</i>&rdquo; his mother moaned, just above her breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are very glad you should have cared&mdash;that they look after you so
well,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, confusedly, at random; feeling, first, that
Hyacinth&rsquo;s coldness was perhaps excessive and his scepticism too marked,
and then that allusions to the way the poor woman was looked after were not
exactly happy. They didn&rsquo;t matter, however, for she evidently heard
nothing, giving no sign of interest even when Mrs Bowerbank, in a tone between
a desire to make the interview more lively and an idea of showing that she knew
how to treat the young, referred herself to the little boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there nothing the little gentleman would like to say, now, to the
unfortunate? Hasn&rsquo;t he any pleasant remark to make to her about his
coming so far to see her when she&rsquo;s so sunk? It isn&rsquo;t often that
children are shown over the place (as the little man has been), and
there&rsquo;s many that would think they were lucky if they could see what he
has seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mon pauvre joujou, mon pauvre chéri</i>,&rdquo; the prisoner went on,
in her tender, tragic whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He only wants to be very good; he always sits that way at home,&rdquo;
said Miss Pynsent, alarmed at Mrs Bowerbank&rsquo;s address and hoping there
wouldn&rsquo;t be a scene.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He might have stayed at home then&mdash;with this wretched person
moaning after him,&rdquo; Mrs Bowerbank remarked, with some sternness. She
plainly felt that the occasion threatened to be wanting in brilliancy, and
wished to intimate that though she was to be trusted for discipline, she
thought they were all getting off too easily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I came because Pinnie brought me,&rdquo; Hyacinth declared, from his low
perch. &ldquo;I thought at first it would be pleasant. But it ain&rsquo;t
pleasant&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like prisons.&rdquo; And he placed his little feet
on the cross-piece of the stool, as if to touch the institution at as few
points as possible.
</p>

<p>
The woman in bed continued her strange, almost whining plaint. &ldquo;<i>Il ne
veut pas s&rsquo;approcher, il a honte de moi</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a many that begin like that!&rdquo; laughed Mrs Bowerbank,
who was irritated by the boy&rsquo;s contempt for one of her Majesty&rsquo;s
finest establishments.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth&rsquo;s little white face exhibited no confusion; he only turned it to
the prisoner again, and Miss Pynsent felt that some extraordinary dumb exchange
of meanings was taking place between them. &ldquo;She used to be so elegant;
she <i>was</i> a fine woman,&rdquo; she observed, gently and helplessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Il a honte de moi&mdash;il a honte, Dieu le pardonne!</i>&rdquo;
Florentine Vivier went on, never moving her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s asking for something, in her language. I used to know a few
words,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, stroking down the bed, very nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is that woman? what does she want?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, his small,
clear voice ringing over the dreary room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She wants you to come near her, she wants to kiss you, sir,&rdquo; said
Mrs Bowerbank, as if it were more than he deserved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss her; Pinnie says she stole a watch!&rdquo; the child
answered with resolution.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you dreadful&mdash;how could you ever?&rdquo; cried Pinnie, blushing
all over and starting out of her chair.
</p>

<p>
It was partly Amanda&rsquo;s agitation, perhaps, which, by the jolt it
administered, gave an impulse to the sick woman, and partly the penetrating and
expressive tone in which Hyacinth announced his repugnance: at any rate,
Florentine, in the most unexpected and violent manner, jerked herself up from
her pillow, and, with dilated eyes and waving hands, shrieked out,
&ldquo;<i>Ah, quelle infamie!</i> I never stole a watch, I never stole
anything&mdash;anything! <i>Ah, par exemple!</i>&rdquo; Then she fell back,
sobbing with the passion that had given her a moment&rsquo;s strength.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you needn&rsquo;t put more on her than she has by
rights,&rdquo; said Mrs Bowerbank, with dignity, to the dressmaker, laying a
large red hand upon the patient, to keep her in her place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mercy, more? I thought it so much less!&rdquo; cried Miss Pynsent,
convulsed with confusion and jerking herself, in a wild tremor, from the mother
to the child, as if she wished to fling herself upon one for contrition and
upon the other for revenge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Il a honte de moi&mdash;il a honte de moi!</i>&rdquo; Florentine
repeated, in the misery of her sobs, &ldquo;<i>Dieu de bonté, quelle
horreur!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent dropped on her knees beside the bed and, trying to possess herself
of Florentine&rsquo;s hand again, protested with a passion almost equal to that
of the prisoner (she felt that her nerves had been screwed up to the
snapping-point, and now they were all in shreds) that she hadn&rsquo;t meant
what she had told the child, that he hadn&rsquo;t understood, that Florentine
herself hadn&rsquo;t understood, that she had only said she had been accused
and meant that no one had ever believed it. The Frenchwoman paid no attention
to her whatever, and Amanda buried her face and her embarrassment in the side
of the hard little prison-bed, while, above the sound of their common
lamentation, she heard the judicial tones of Mrs Bowerbank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The child is delicate, you might well say! I&rsquo;m disappointed in the
effect&mdash;I was in hopes you&rsquo;d hearten her up. The doctor&rsquo;ll be
down on <i>me</i>, of course; so we&rsquo;ll just pass out again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry I made you cry. And you must excuse Pinnie&mdash;I
asked her so many questions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These words came from close beside the prostrate dressmaker, who, lifting
herself quickly, found the little boy had advanced to her elbow and was taking
a nearer view of the mysterious captive. They produced upon the latter an
effect even more powerful than his unfortunate speech of a moment before; for
she found strength to raise herself, partly, in her bed again, and to hold out
her arms to him, with the same thrilling sobs. She was talking still, but she
had become quite inarticulate, and Miss Pynsent had but a glimpse of her white,
ravaged face, with the hollows of its eyes and the rude crop of her hair.
Amanda caught the child with an eagerness almost as great as
Florentine&rsquo;s, and drawing him to the head of the bed, pushed him into his
mother&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Kiss her&mdash;kiss her, and we&rsquo;ll go
home!&rdquo; she whispered desperately, while they closed about him, and the
poor dishonoured head pressed itself against his young cheek. It was a
terrible, irresistible embrace, to which Hyacinth submitted with instant
patience. Mrs Bowerbank had tried at first to keep her <i>protégée</i> from
rising, evidently wishing to abbreviate the scene; then, as the child was
enfolded, she accepted the situation and gave judicious support from behind,
with an eye to clearing the room as soon as this effort should have spent
itself. She propped up her patient with a vigorous arm; Miss Pynsent rose from
her knees and turned away, and there was a minute&rsquo;s stillness, during
which the boy accommodated himself as he might to his strange ordeal. What
thoughts were begotten at that moment in his wondering little mind Miss Pynsent
was destined to learn at another time. Before she had faced round to the bed
again she was swept out of the room by Mrs Bowerbank, who had lowered the
prisoner, exhausted, with closed eyes, to her pillow, and given Hyacinth a
business-like little push, which sent him on in advance. Miss Pynsent went home
in a cab&mdash;she was so shaken; though she reflected, very nervously, on
getting into it, on the opportunities it would give Hyacinth for the exercise
of inquisitorial rights. To her surprise, however, he completely neglected
them; he sat in silence, looking out of the window, till they re-entered Lomax
Place.

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to guess my name before I&rsquo;ll tell
you,&rdquo; the girl said, with a free laugh, pushing her way into the narrow
hall and leaning against the tattered wall-paper, which, representing blocks of
marble with bevelled edges, in streaks and speckles of black and gray, had not
been renewed for years and came back to her out of the past. As Miss Pynsent
closed the door, seeing her visitor was so resolute, the light filtered in from
the street, through the narrow, dusty glass above it, and then the very smell
and sense of the place returned to Millicent; a kind of musty dimness, with the
vision of a small, steep staircase at the end, covered with a strip of oilcloth
which she recognised, and made a little less dark by a window in the bend (you
could see it from the hall), from which you could almost bump your head against
the house behind. Nothing was changed except Miss Pynsent, and of course the
girl herself. She had noticed, outside, that the sign between the windows had
not even been touched up; there was still the same preposterous announcement of
&lsquo;fashionable bonnets&rsquo;&mdash;as if the poor little dressmaker had
the slightest acquaintance with that style of head-dress, of which Miss
Henning&rsquo;s own knowledge was now so complete. She could see Miss Pynsent
was looking at her hat, which was a wonderful composition of flowers and
ribbons; her eyes had travelled up and down Millicent&rsquo;s whole person, but
they rested in fascination upon this ornament. The girl had forgotten how small
the dressmaker was; she barely came up to her shoulder. She had lost her hair,
and wore a cap, which Millicent noticed in return, wondering if that were a
specimen of what she thought the fashion. Miss Pynsent stared up at her as if
she had been six feet high; but she was used to that sort of surprised
admiration, being perfectly conscious that she was a magnificent young woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take me into your shop?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to order anything; I only want to inquire after your
&rsquo;ealth; and isn&rsquo;t this rather an awkward place to talk?&rdquo; She
made her way further in, without waiting for permission, seeing that her
startled hostess had not yet guessed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The show-room is on the right hand,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, with her
professional manner, which was intended, evidently, to mark a difference. She
spoke as if on the other side, where the horizon was bounded by the partition
of the next house, there were labyrinths of apartments. Passing in after her
guest she found the young lady already spread out upon the sofa, the
everlasting sofa, in the right-hand corner as you faced the window, covered
with a light, shrunken shroud of a strange yellow stuff, the tinge of which
revealed years of washing, and surmounted by a coloured print of Rebekah at the
Well, balancing, in the opposite quarter, with a portrait of the Empress of the
French, taken from an illustrated newspaper and framed and glazed in the manner
of 1853. Millicent looked about her, asking herself what Miss Pynsent had to
show and acting perfectly the part of the most brilliant figure the place had
ever contained. The old implements were there on the table: the pincushions and
needle-books; the pink measuring-tape with which, as children, she and Hyacinth
used to take each other&rsquo;s height; and the same collection of
fashion-plates (she could see in a minute), crumpled, sallow and fly-blown. The
little dressmaker bristled, as she used to do, with needles and pins (they were
stuck all over the front of her dress), but there were no rustling fabrics
tossed in heaps about the room&mdash;nothing but the skirt of a shabby dress
(it might have been her own), which she was evidently repairing and had flung
upon the table when she came to the door. Miss Henning speedily arrived at the
conclusion that her hostess&rsquo;s business had not increased, and felt a kind
of good-humoured, luxurious scorn of a person who knew so little what was to be
got out of London. It was Millicent&rsquo;s belief that she herself was already
perfectly acquainted with the resources of the metropolis.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now tell me, how is Hyacinth? I should like so much to see him,&rdquo;
she remarked, extending a pair of large protrusive feet and supporting herself
on the sofa by her hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hyacinth?&rdquo; Miss Pynsent repeated, with majestic blankness, as if
she had never heard of such a person. She felt that the girl was cruelly,
scathingly, well dressed; she couldn&rsquo;t imagine who she was, nor with what
design she could have presented herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you call him Mr Robinson, to-day&mdash;you always wanted him to
hold himself so high. But to his face, at any rate, I&rsquo;ll call him as I
used to: you see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless my soul, you must be the little &rsquo;Enning!&rdquo; Miss Pynsent
exclaimed, planted before her and going now into every detail.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you have made up your mind. I thought you&rsquo;d
know me directly. I had a call to make in this part, and it came into my
&rsquo;ead to look you up. I don&rsquo;t like to lose sight of old
friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never knew you&mdash;you&rsquo;ve improved so,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent
rejoined, with a candour justified by her age and her consciousness of
respectability.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> haven&rsquo;t changed; you were always calling me
something horrid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say it doesn&rsquo;t matter to you now, does it?&rdquo; said the
dressmaker, seating herself, but quite unable to take up her work, absorbed as
she was in the examination of her visitor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; Miss Henning replied, with the air
of one who had nothing to fear from human judgments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were a pretty child&mdash;I never said the contrary to that; but I
had no idea you&rsquo;d turn out like this. You&rsquo;re too tall for a
woman,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent added, much divided between an old prejudice and a
new appreciation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I enjoy beautiful &rsquo;ealth,&rdquo; said the young lady;
&ldquo;every one thinks I&rsquo;m twenty.&rdquo; She spoke with a certain
artless pride in her bigness and her bloom, and as if, to show her development,
she would have taken off her jacket or let you feel her upper arm. She was very
handsome, with a shining, bold, good-natured eye, a fine, free, facial oval, an
abundance of brown hair, and a smile which showed the whiteness of her teeth.
Her head was set upon a fair, strong neck, and her tall young figure was rich
in feminine curves. Her gloves, covering her wrists insufficiently, showed the
redness of those parts, in the interstices of the numerous silver bracelets
that encircled them, and Miss Pynsent made the observation that her hands were
not more delicate than her feet. She was not graceful, and even the little
dressmaker, whose preference for distinguished forms never deserted her,
indulged in the mental reflection that she was common, for all her
magnificence; but there was something about her indescribably fresh, successful
and satisfying. She was, to her blunt, expanded finger-tips, a daughter of
London, of the crowded streets and hustling traffic of the great city; she had
drawn her health and strength from its dingy courts and foggy thoroughfares,
and peopled its parks and squares and crescents with her ambitions; it had
entered into her blood and her bone, the sound of her voice and the carriage of
her head; she understood it by instinct and loved it with passion; she
represented its immense vulgarities and curiosities, its brutality and its
knowingness, its good-nature and its impudence, and might have figured, in an
allegorical procession, as a kind of glorified townswoman, a nymph of the
wilderness of Middlesex, a flower of the accumulated parishes, the genius of
urban civilisation, the muse of cockneyism. The restrictions under which Miss
Pynsent regarded her would have cost the dressmaker some fewer scruples if she
had guessed the impression she made upon Millicent, and how the whole place
seemed to that prosperous young lady to smell of poverty and failure. Her
childish image of Miss Pynsent had represented her as delicate and dainty, with
round loops of hair fastened on her temples by combs, and associations of
brilliancy arising from the constant manipulation of precious
stuffs&mdash;tissues at least which Millicent regarded with envy. But the
little woman before her was bald and white and pinched; she looked shrunken and
sickly and insufficiently nourished; her small eyes were sharp and suspicious,
and her hideous cap did not disguise her meagreness. Miss Henning thanked her
stars, as she had often done before, that she had not been obliged to get
<i>her</i> living by drudging over needlework year after year in that
undiscoverable street, in a dismal little room where nothing had been changed
for ages; the absence of change had such an exasperating effect upon her
vigorous young nature. She reflected with complacency upon her good fortune in
being attached to a more exciting, a more dramatic, department of the
dressmaking business, and noticed that though it was already November there was
no fire in the neatly-kept grate beneath the chimney-piece, on which a design,
partly architectural, partly botanical, executed in the hair of Miss
Pynsent&rsquo;s parents, was flanked by a pair of vases, under glass,
containing muslin flowers.
</p>

<p>
If she thought Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s eyes suspicious it must be confessed that
this lady felt very much upon her guard in the presence of so unexpected and
undesired a reminder of one of the least honourable episodes in the annals of
Lomax Place. Miss Pynsent esteemed people in proportion to their success in
constituting a family circle&mdash;in cases, that is, when the materials were
under their hand. This success, among the various members of the house of
Henning, had been of the scantiest, and the domestic broils in the
establishment adjacent to her own, whose vicissitudes she was able to follow,
as she sat at her window at work, by simply inclining an ear to the thin
partition behind her&mdash;these scenes, amid which the crash of crockery and
the imprecations of the wounded were frequently audible, had long been the
scandal of a humble but harmonious neighbourhood. Mr Henning was supposed to
occupy a place of confidence in a brush-factory, while his wife, at home,
occupied herself with the washing and mending of a considerable brood, mainly
of sons. But economy and sobriety, and indeed a virtue more important still,
had never presided at their councils. The freedom and frequency of Mrs
Henning&rsquo;s relations with a stove-polisher in the Euston Road were at
least not a secret to a person who lived next door and looked up from her work
so often that it was a wonder it was always finished so quickly. The little
Hennings, unwashed and unchidden, spent most of their time either in pushing
each other into the gutter or in running to the public-house at the corner for
a pennyworth of gin, and the borrowing propensities of their elders were a
theme for exclamation. There was no object of personal or domestic use which
Mrs Henning had not at one time or another endeavoured to elicit from the
dressmaker; beginning with a mattress, on an occasion when she was about to
take to her bed for a considerable period, and ending with a flannel petticoat
and a pewter teapot. Lomax Place had, eventually, from its over-peeping windows
and doorways, been present at the seizure, by a long-suffering landlord, of the
chattels of this interesting family and at the ejectment of the whole insolvent
group, who departed in a straggling, jeering, unabashed, cynical manner,
carrying with them but little of the sympathy of the street. Millicent, whose
childish intimacy with Hyacinth Robinson Miss Pynsent had always viewed with
vague anxiety&mdash;she thought the girl a &lsquo;nasty little thing&rsquo;,
and was afraid she would teach the innocent orphan low ways&mdash;Millicent,
with her luxuriant tresses, her precocious beauty, her staring, mocking manner
on the doorstep, was at this time twelve years of age. She vanished with her
vanishing companions; Lomax Place saw them turn the corner, and returned to its
occupations with a conviction that they would make shipwreck on the outer
reefs. But neither spar nor splinter floated back to their former haunts, and
they were engulfed altogether in the fathomless deeps of the town. Miss Pynsent
drew a long breath; it was her conviction that none of them would come to any
good, and Millicent least of all.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, this young lady reappeared, with all the signs of accomplished
survival, she could not fail to ask herself whether, under a specious seeming,
the phenomenon did not simply represent the triumph of vice. She was alarmed,
but she would have given her silver thimble to know the girl&rsquo;s history,
and between her alarm and her curiosity she passed an uncomfortable half-hour.
She felt that the familiar, mysterious creature was playing with her; revenging
herself for former animadversions, for having been snubbed and miscalled by a
peering little spinster who now could make no figure beside her. If it was not
the triumph of vice it was at least the triumph of impertinence, as well as of
youth, health, and a greater acquaintance with the art of dress than Miss
Pynsent could boast, for all her ridiculous signboards. She perceived, or she
believed she perceived, that Millicent wanted to scare her, to make her think
she had come after Hyacinth; that she wished to inveigle, to corrupt him. I
should be sorry to impute to Miss Henning any motive more complicated than the
desire to amuse herself, of a Saturday afternoon, by a ramble which her
vigorous legs had no occasion to deprecate; but it must be confessed that when
it occurred to her that Miss Pynsent regarded her as a ravening wolf and her
early playmate as an unspotted lamb, she laughed out, in her hostess&rsquo;s
anxious face, irrelevantly and good-humouredly, without deigning to explain.
But what, indeed, had she come for, if she had not come after Hyacinth? It was
not for the love of the dressmaker&rsquo;s pretty ways. She remembered the boy
and some of their tender passages, and in the wantonness of her full-blown
freedom&mdash;her attachment, also, to any tolerable pretext for wandering
through the streets of London and gazing into shop-windows&mdash;she had said
to herself that she would dedicate an afternoon to the pleasures of memory,
would revisit the scenes of her childhood. She considered that her childhood
had ended with the departure of her family from Lomax Place. If the tenants of
that obscure locality never learned what their banished fellows went through,
Millicent retained a deep impression of those horrible intermediate years. The
family, as a family, had gone down-hill, to the very bottom; and in her humbler
moments Millicent sometimes wondered what lucky star had checked her own
descent, and indeed enabled her to mount the slope again. In her humbler
moments, I say, for as a general thing she was provided with an explanation of
any good fortune that might befall her. What was more natural than that a girl
should do well when she was at once so handsome and so clever? Millicent
thought with compassion of the young persons whom a niggardly fate had endowed
with only one of these advantages. She was good-natured, but she had no idea of
gratifying Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s curiosity; it seemed to her quite a sufficient
kindness to stimulate it.
</p>

<p>
She told the dressmaker that she had a high position at a great
haberdasher&rsquo;s in the neighbourhood of Buckingham Palace; she was in the
department for jackets and mantles; she put on all these articles to show them
off to the customers, and on her person they appeared to such advantage that
nothing she took up ever failed to go off. Miss Pynsent could imagine, from
this, how highly her services were prized. She had had a splendid offer from
another establishment, in Oxford Street, and she was just thinking whether she
should accept it. &ldquo;We have to be beautifully dressed, but I don&rsquo;t
care, because I like to look nice,&rdquo; she remarked to her hostess, who at
the end of half an hour, very grave, behind the clumsy glasses which she had
been obliged to wear of late years, seemed still not to know what to make of
her. On the subject of her family, of her history during the interval that was
to be accounted for, the girl was large and vague, and Miss Pynsent saw that
the domestic circle had not even a shadow of sanctity for her. She stood on her
own feet, and she stood very firm. Her staying so long, her remaining over the
half-hour, proved to the dressmaker that she had come for Hyacinth; for poor
Amanda gave her as little information as was decent, told her nothing that
would encourage or attract. She simply mentioned that Mr Robinson (she was
careful to speak of him in that manner) had given his attention to bookbinding,
and had served an apprenticeship at an establishment where they turned out the
best work of that kind that was to be found in London.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bookbindery? Laws!&rdquo; said Miss Henning. &ldquo;Do you mean they
get them up for the shops? Well, I always thought he would have something to do
with books.&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t think he would
ever follow a trade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A trade?&rdquo; cried Miss Pynsent. &ldquo;You should hear Mr Robinson
speak of it. He considers it one of the fine arts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millicent smiled, as if she knew how people often considered things, and
remarked that very likely it was tidy, comfortable work, but she couldn&rsquo;t
believe there was much to be seen in it. &ldquo;Perhaps you will say there is
more than there is here,&rdquo; she went on, finding at last an effect of
irritation, of reprehension, an implication of aggressive respectability, in
the image of the patient dressmaker, sitting for so many years in her close,
brown little den, with the foggy familiarities of Lomax Place on the other side
of the pane. Millicent liked to think that she herself was strong, and she was
not strong enough for that.
</p>

<p>
This allusion to her shrunken industry seemed to Miss Pynsent very cruel; but
she reflected that it was natural one should be insulted if one talked to a
vulgar girl. She judged this young lady in the manner of a person who was not
vulgar herself, and if there was a difference between them she was right in
feeling it to be in her favour. Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s &lsquo;cut&rsquo;, as I
have intimated, was not truly fashionable, and in the application of gimp and
the distribution of ornament she was not to be trusted; but, morally, she had
the best taste in the world. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t so much work as I used to
have, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. My eyes are not so good, and my health has
failed with advancing years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I know not to what extent Millicent was touched by the dignity of this
admission, but she replied, without embarrassment, that what Miss Pynsent
wanted was a smart young assistant, some nice girl with a pretty taste, who
would brighten up the business and give her new ideas. &ldquo;I can see you
have got the same old ones, always: I can tell that by the way you have stuck
the braid on that dress;&rdquo; and she directed a poke of her neat little
umbrella to the drapery in the dressmaker&rsquo;s lap. She continued to
patronise and exasperate her, and to offer her consolation and encouragement
with the heaviest hand that had ever been applied to Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s
sensitive surface. Poor Amanda ended by gazing at her as if she were a public
performer of some kind, a ballad-singer or a conjurer, and went so far as to
ask herself whether the hussy could be (in her own mind) the &lsquo;nice
girl&rsquo; who was to regild the tarnished sign. Miss Pynsent had had
assistants, in the past&mdash;she had even, once, for a few months, had a
&lsquo;forewoman&rsquo;; and some of these damsels had been precious specimens,
whose misdemeanours lived vividly in her memory. Never, all the same, in her
worst hour of delusion, had she trusted her interests to such an extravagant
baggage as this. She was quickly reassured as to Millicent&rsquo;s own views,
perceiving more and more that she was a tremendous highflyer, who required a
much larger field of action than the musty bower she now honoured, heaven only
knew why, with her presence. Miss Pynsent held her tongue, as she always did,
when the sorrow of her life had been touched, the thought of the slow,
inexorable decline on which she had entered that day, nearly ten years before,
when her hesitations and scruples resolved themselves into a hideous mistake.
The deep conviction of error, on that unspeakably important occasion, had ached
and throbbed within her ever since like an incurable disease. She had sown in
her boy&rsquo;s mind the seeds of shame and rancour; she had made him conscious
of his stigma, of his exquisitely vulnerable spot, and condemned him to know
that for him the sun would never shine as it shone for most others. By the time
he was sixteen years old she had learned&mdash;or believed she had
learned&mdash;the judgment he passed upon her, and at that period she had lived
through a series of horrible months, an ordeal in which every element of her
old prosperity perished. She cried her eyes out, on coming to a sense of her
aberration, blinded and weakened herself with weeping, so that for a moment it
seemed as if she should never be able to touch a needle again. She lost all
interest in her work, and that artistic imagination which had always been her
pride deserted her, together with the reputation of keeping the tidiest
lodgings in Lomax Place. A couple of commercial gentlemen and a Welsh plumber,
of religious tendencies, who for several years had made her establishment their
home, withdrew their patronage on the ground that the airing of her beds was
not what it used to be, and disseminated cruelly this injurious legend. She
ceased to notice or to care how sleeves were worn, and on the question of
flounces and gores her mind was a blank. She fell into a grievous debility, and
then into a long, low, languid fever, during which Hyacinth tended her with a
devotion which only made the wrong she had done him seem more bitter, and in
which, so soon as she was able to hold up her head a little, Mr Vetch came and
sat with her through the dull hours of convalescence. She re-established to a
certain extent, after a while, her connection, so far as the letting of her
rooms was concerned (from the other department of her activity the tide had
ebbed apparently forever); but nothing was the same again, and she knew it was
the beginning of the end. So it had gone on, and she watched the end approach;
she felt it was very near indeed when a child she had seen playing in the
gutters came to flaunt it over her in silk and lace. She gave a low, inaudible
sigh of relief when at last Millicent got up and stood before her, smoothing
the glossy cylinder of her umbrella.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mind you give my love to Hyacinth,&rdquo; the girl said, with an
assurance which showed all her insensibility to tacit protests. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care if you do guess that if I have stopped so long it was in the
hope he would be dropping in to his tea. You can tell him I sat an hour, on
purpose, if you like; there&rsquo;s no shame in my wanting to see my little
friend. He may know I call him that!&rdquo; Millicent continued, with her
show-room laugh, as Miss Pynsent judged it to be; conferring these permissions,
successively, as if they were great indulgences. &ldquo;Do give him my love,
and tell him I hope he&rsquo;ll come and see me. I see you won&rsquo;t tell him
anything. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re afraid of; but I&rsquo;ll leave
my card for him, all the same.&rdquo; She drew forth a little bright-coloured
pocket-book, and it was with amazement that Miss Pynsent saw her extract from
it a morsel of engraved pasteboard&mdash;so monstrous did it seem that one of
the squalid little Hennings should have lived to display this emblem of social
consideration. Millicent enjoyed the effect she produced as she laid the card
on the table, and gave another ringing peal of merriment at the sight of her
hostess&rsquo;s half-angry, half-astonished look. &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you
think I want to do with him? I could swallow him at a single bite!&rdquo; she
cried.
</p>

<p>
Poor Amanda gave no second glance at the document on the table, though she had
perceived it contained, in the corner, her visitor&rsquo;s address, which
Millicent had amused herself, ingeniously, with not mentioning: she only got
up, laying down her work with a trembling hand, so that she should be able to
see Miss Henning well out of the house. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think I shall
put myself out to keep him in the dark. I shall certainly tell him you have
been here, and exactly how you strike me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll say something nasty&mdash;like you used to when I
was a child. You let me &rsquo;ave it then, you know!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, nettled at being reminded of an
acerbity which the girl&rsquo;s present development caused to appear
ridiculously ineffectual, &ldquo;you are very different now, when I think what
you&rsquo;ve come from.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve come from?&rdquo; Millicent threw back her head, and
opened her eyes very wide, while all her feathers and ribbons nodded.
&ldquo;Did you want me to stick fast in this low place for the rest of my days?
You have had to stay in it yourself, so you might speak civilly of it.&rdquo;
She coloured, and raised her voice, and looked magnificent in her scorn.
&ldquo;And pray what have you come from yourself, and what has <i>he</i> come
from&mdash;the mysterious &lsquo;Mr Robinson&rsquo;, that used to be such a
puzzle to the whole Place? I thought perhaps I might clear it up, but you
haven&rsquo;t told me that yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent turned straight away, covering her ears with her hands. &ldquo;I
have nothing to tell you! Leave my room&mdash;leave my house!&rdquo; she cried,
with a trembling voice.
</p>

<p>
It was in this way that the dressmaker failed either to see or to hear the
opening of the door of the room, which obeyed a slow, apparently cautious
impulse given it from the hall, and revealed the figure of a young man standing
there with a short pipe in his teeth. There was something in his face which
immediately told Millicent Henning that he had heard, outside, her last
resounding tones. He entered as if, young as he was, he knew that when women
were squabbling men were not called upon to be headlong, and evidently wondered
who the dressmaker&rsquo;s brilliant adversary might be. She recognised on the
instant her old playmate, and without reflection, confusion or diplomacy, in
the fullness of her vulgarity and sociability, she exclaimed, in no lower
pitch, &ldquo;Gracious, Hyacinth Robinson, is <i>that</i> your form?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent turned round, in a flash, but kept silent; then, very white and
trembling, took up her work again and seated herself in her window.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth Robinson stood staring; then he blushed all over. He knew who she was,
but he didn&rsquo;t say so; he only asked, in a voice which struck the girl as
quite different from the old one&mdash;the one in which he used to tell her she
was beastly tiresome&mdash;&ldquo;Is it of me you were speaking just
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I asked where you had come from? That was because we &rsquo;eard
you in the &rsquo;all,&rdquo; said Millicent, smiling. &ldquo;I suppose you
have come from your work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You used to live in the Place&mdash;you always wanted to kiss me,&rdquo;
the young man remarked, with an effort not to show all the surprise and
agitation that he felt. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she live in the Place,
Pinnie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pinnie, for all answer, fixed a pair of strange, pleading eyes upon him, and
Millicent broke out, with her recurrent laugh, in which the dressmaker had been
right in discovering the note of affectation, &ldquo;Do you want to know what
you look like? You look for all the world like a little Frenchman! Don&rsquo;t
he look like a little Frenchman, Miss Pynsent?&rdquo; she went on, as if she
were on the best possible terms with the mistress of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth exchanged a look with that afflicted woman; he saw something in her
face which he knew very well by this time, and the sight of which always gave
him an odd, perverse, unholy satisfaction. It seemed to say that she prostrated
herself, that she did penance in the dust, that she was his to trample upon, to
spit upon. He did neither of these things, but she was constantly offering
herself, and her permanent humility, her perpetual abjection, was a sort of
counter-irritant to the soreness lodged in his own heart for ever, which had
often made him cry with rage at night, in his little room under the roof.
Pinnie meant that, to-day, as a matter of course, and she could only especially
mean it in the presence of Miss Henning&rsquo;s remark about his looking like a
Frenchman. He knew he looked like a Frenchman, he had often been told so
before, and a large part of the time he felt like one&mdash;like one of those
he had read about in Michelet and Carlyle. He had picked up the French tongue
with the most extraordinary facility, with the aid of one of his mates, a
refugee from Paris, in the workroom, and of a second-hand dog&rsquo;s-eared
dictionary, bought for a shilling in the Brompton Road, in one of his
interminable, restless, melancholy, moody, yet all-observant strolls through
London. He spoke it (as he believed) as if by instinct, caught the accent, the
gesture, the movement of eyebrow and shoulder; so that if it should become
necessary in certain contingencies that he should pass for a foreigner he had
an idea that he might do so triumphantly, once he could borrow a blouse. He had
never seen a blouse in his life, but he knew exactly the form and colour of
such a garment, and how it was worn. What these contingencies might be which
should compel him to assume the disguise of a person of a social station lower
still than his own, Hyacinth would not for the world have mentioned to you; but
as they were very present to the mind of our imaginative, ingenious youth we
shall catch a glimpse of them in the course of a further acquaintance with him.
At the present moment, when there was no question of masquerading, it made him
blush again that such a note should be struck by a loud, laughing, handsome
girl, who came back out of his past. There was more in Pinnie&rsquo;s weak
eyes, now, than her usual profession; there was a dumb intimation, almost as
pathetic as the other, that if he cared to let her off easily he would not
detain their terrible visitor very long. He had no wish to do that; he kept the
door open, on purpose; he didn&rsquo;t enjoy talking to girls under
Pinnie&rsquo;s eyes, and he could see that this one had every disposition to
talk. So without responding to her observation about his appearance he said,
not knowing exactly what to say, &ldquo;Have you come back to live in the
Place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heaven forbid I should ever do that!&rdquo; cried Miss Henning, with
genuine emotion. &ldquo;I have to live near the establishment in which
I&rsquo;m employed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what establishment is that, now?&rdquo; the young man asked, gaining
confidence and perceiving, in detail, how handsome she was. He hadn&rsquo;t
roamed about London for nothing, and he knew that when a girl was so handsome
as that, a jocular tone of address, a pleasing freedom, was <i>de rigueur;</i>
so he added, &ldquo;Is it the Bull and Gate, or the Elephant and Castle?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A public house! Well, you haven&rsquo;t got the politeness of a
Frenchman, at all events!&rdquo; Her good-nature had come back to her
perfectly, and her resentment of his imputation of her looking like a
bar-maid&mdash;a blowzy beauty who handled pewter&mdash;was tempered by her
more and more curious consideration of Hyacinth&rsquo;s form. He was
exceedingly &lsquo;rum&rsquo;, but this quality took her fancy, and since he
remembered so well that she had been fond of kissing him, in their early days
she would have liked to say to him that she stood prepared to repeat this form
of attention. But she reminded herself, in time, that her line should be,
religiously, the ladylike, and she was content to exclaim, simply, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care what a man looks like so long as he&rsquo;s clever.
That&rsquo;s the form <i>I</i> like!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent had promised herself the satisfaction of taking no further notice
of her brilliant invader; but the temptation was great to expose her to
Hyacinth, as a mitigation of her brilliancy, by remarking sarcastically,
according to opportunity, &ldquo;Miss &rsquo;Enning wouldn&rsquo;t live in
Lomax Place for the world. She thinks it too abominably low.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is; it&rsquo;s a beastly hole,&rdquo; said the young man.
</p>

<p>
The poor dressmaker&rsquo;s little dart fell to the ground, and Millicent
exclaimed, jovially, &ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; while she directed to the
object of her childhood&rsquo;s admiration a smile that put him more and more
at his ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I&rsquo;m clever?&rdquo; he asked, planted
before her with his little legs slightly apart, while, with his hands behind
him, he made the open door waver to and fro.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You? Oh, I don&rsquo;t care whether you are or not!&rdquo; said
Millicent Henning; and Hyacinth was at any rate quick-witted enough to see what
she meant by that. If she meant he was so good-looking that he might pass on
this score alone her judgment was conceivable, though many women would strongly
have dissented from it. He was as small as he had threatened&mdash;he had never
got his growth&mdash;and she could easily see that he was not what she, at
least, would call strong. His bones were small, his chest was narrow, his
complexion pale, his whole figure almost childishly slight; and Millicent
perceived afterward that he had a very delicate hand&mdash;the hand, as she
said to herself, of a gentleman. What she liked was his face, and something
jaunty and entertaining, almost theatrical in his whole little person. Miss
Henning was not acquainted with any member of the dramatic profession, but she
supposed, vaguely, that that was the way an actor would look in private life.
Hyacinth&rsquo;s features were perfect; his eyes, large and much divided, had
as their usual expression a kind of witty candour, and a small, soft, fair
moustache disposed itself upon his upper lip in a way that made him look as if
he were smiling even when his heart was heavy. The waves of his dense, fine
hair clustered round a forehead which was high enough to suggest remarkable
things, and Miss Henning had observed that when he first appeared he wore his
little soft circular hat in a way that left these frontal locks very visible.
He was dressed in an old brown velveteen jacket, and wore exactly the
bright-coloured necktie which Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s quick fingers used of old to
shape out of hoarded remnants of silk and muslin. He was shabby and
work-stained, but the observant eye would have noted an idea in his dress (his
appearance was plainly not a matter of indifference to himself), and a painter
(not of the heroic) would have liked to make a sketch of him. There was
something exotic about him, and yet, with his sharp young face, destitute of
bloom, but not of sweetness, and a certain conscious cockneyism which pervaded
him, he was as strikingly as Millicent, in her own degree, a product of the
London streets and the London air. He looked both ingenuous and slightly
wasted, amused, amusing, and indefinably sad. Women had always found him
touching; yet he made them&mdash;so they had repeatedly assured him&mdash;die
of laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you had better shut the door,&rdquo; said Miss Pynsent, meaning
that he had better shut their departing visitor out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you come here on purpose to see us?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, not
heeding this injunction, of which he divined the spirit, and wishing the girl
would take her leave, so that he might go out again with her. He should like
talking with her much better away from Pinnie, who evidently was ready to stick
a bodkin into her, for reasons he perfectly understood. He had seen plenty of
them before, Pinnie&rsquo;s reasons, even where girls were concerned who were
not nearly so good-looking as this one. She was always in a fearful
&lsquo;funk&rsquo; about some woman getting hold of him, and persuading him to
make a marriage beneath his station. His station!&mdash;poor Hyacinth had often
asked himself, and Miss Pynsent, what it could possibly be. He had thought of
it bitterly enough, and wondered how in the world he could marry
&lsquo;beneath&rsquo; it. He would never marry at all&mdash;to that his mind
was absolutely made up; he would never hand on to another the burden which had
made his own young spirit so intolerably sore, the inheritance which had
darkened the whole threshold of his manhood. All the more reason why he should
have his compensation; why, if the soft society of women was to be enjoyed on
other terms, he should cultivate it with a bold, free mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I would just give a look at the old shop; I had an engagement
not far off,&rdquo; Millicent said. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed
any one who had told me I should find you just where I left you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We needed you to look after us!&rdquo; Miss Pynsent exclaimed,
irrepressibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re such a swell yourself!&rdquo; Hyacinth observed,
without heeding the dressmaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None of your impudence! I&rsquo;m as good a girl as there is in
London!&rdquo; And to corroborate this, Miss Henning went on: &ldquo;If you
were to offer to see me a part of the way home, I should tell you I don&rsquo;t
knock about that way with gentlemen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you as far as you like,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied,
simply, as if he knew how to treat that sort of speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only because I knew you as a baby!&rdquo; And they went
out together, Hyacinth careful not to look at poor Pinnie at all (he felt her
glaring whitely and tearfully at him out of her dim corner&mdash;it had by this
time grown too dusky to work without a lamp), and his companion giving her an
outrageously friendly nod of farewell over her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
It was a long walk from Lomax Place to the quarter of the town in which (to be
near the haberdasher&rsquo;s in the Buckingham Palace Road) Miss Henning
occupied a modest back-room; but the influences of the hour were such as to
make the excursion very agreeable to our young man, who liked the streets at
all times, but especially at nightfall, in the autumn, of a Saturday, when, in
the vulgar districts, the smaller shops and open-air industries were doubly
active, and big, clumsy torches flared and smoked over hand-carts and
costermongers&rsquo; barrows, drawn up in the gutters. Hyacinth had roamed
through the great city since he was an urchin, but his imagination had never
ceased to be stirred by the preparations for Sunday that went on in the evening
among the toilers and spinners, his brothers and sisters, and he lost himself
in all the quickened crowding and pushing and staring at lighted windows and
chaffering at the stalls of fishmongers and hucksters. He liked the people who
looked as if they had got their week&rsquo;s wage and were prepared to lay it
out discreetly; and even those whose use of it would plainly be extravagant and
intemperate; and, best of all, those who evidently hadn&rsquo;t received it at
all and who wandered about, disinterestedly, vaguely, with their hands in empty
pockets, watching others make their bargains and fill their satchels, or
staring at the striated sides of bacon, at the golden cubes and triangles of
cheese, at the graceful festoons of sausage, in the most brilliant of the
windows. He liked the reflection of the lamps on the wet pavements, the feeling
and smell of the carboniferous London damp; the way the winter fog blurred and
suffused the whole place, made it seem bigger and more crowded, produced halos
and dim radiations, trickles and evaporations, on the plates of glass. He moved
in the midst of these impressions this evening, but he enjoyed them in silence,
with an attention taken up mainly by his companion, and pleased to be already
so intimate with a young lady whom people turned round to look at. She herself
affected to speak of the rush and crush of the week&rsquo;s end with disgust:
she said she liked the streets, but she liked the respectable ones; she
couldn&rsquo;t abide the smell of fish, and the whole place seemed full of it,
so that she hoped they would soon get into the Edgware Road, towards which they
tended and which was a proper street for a lady. To Hyacinth she appeared to
have no connection with the long-haired little girl who, in Lomax Place, years
before, was always hugging a smutty doll and courting his society; she was like
a stranger, a new acquaintance, and he observed her curiously, wondering by
what transitions she had reached her present pitch.
</p>

<p>
She enlightened him but little on this point, though she talked a great deal on
a variety of subjects, and mentioned to him her habits, her aspirations, her
likes and dislikes. The latter were very numerous. She was tremendously
particular, difficult to please, he could see that; and she assured him that
she never put up with anything a moment after it had ceased to be agreeable to
her. Especially was she particular about gentlemen&rsquo;s society, and she
made it plain that a young fellow who wanted to have anything to say to her
must be in receipt of wages amounting at the least to fifty shillings a week.
Hyacinth told her that he didn&rsquo;t earn that, as yet; and she remarked
again that she made an exception for him, because she knew all about him (or if
not all, at least a great deal), and he could see that her good-nature was
equal to her beauty. She made such an exception that when, after they were
moving down the Edgware Road (which had still the brightness of late closing,
but with more nobleness), he proposed that she should enter a coffee-house with
him and &lsquo;take something&rsquo; (he could hardly tell himself, afterwards,
what brought him to this point), she acceded without a demur&mdash;without a
demur even on the ground of his slender earnings. Slender as they were,
Hyacinth had them in his pocket (they had been destined in some degree for
Pinnie), and he felt equal to the occasion. Millicent partook profusely of tea
and bread and butter, with a relish of raspberry jam, and thought the place
most comfortable, though he himself, after finding himself ensconced, was
visited by doubts as to its respectability, suggested, among other things, by
photographs, on the walls, of young ladies in tights. Hyacinth himself was
hungry, he had not yet had his tea, but he was too excited, too preoccupied, to
eat; the situation made him restless and gave him palpitations; it seemed to be
the beginning of something new. He had never yet &lsquo;stood&rsquo; even a
glass of beer to a girl of Millicent&rsquo;s stamp&mdash;a girl who rustled and
glittered and smelt of musk&mdash;and if she should turn out as jolly a
specimen of the sex as she seemed it might make a great difference in his
leisure hours, in his evenings, which were often very dull. That it would also
make a difference in his savings (he was under a pledge to Pinnie and to Mr
Vetch to put by something every week) it didn&rsquo;t concern him, for the
moment, to reflect; and indeed, though he thought it odious and insufferable to
be poor, the ways and means of becoming rich had hitherto not greatly occupied
him. He knew what Millicent&rsquo;s age must be, but felt, nevertheless, as if
she were older, much older, than himself&mdash;she appeared to know so much
about London and about life; and this made it still more of a sensation to be
entertaining her like a young swell. He thought of it, too, in connection with
the question of the respectability of the establishment; if this element was
deficient she would perceive it as soon as he, and very likely it would be a
part of the general initiation she had given him an impression of that she
shouldn&rsquo;t mind it so long as the tea was strong and the bread and butter
thick. She described to him what had passed between Miss Pynsent and herself
(she didn&rsquo;t call her Pinnie, and he was glad, for he wouldn&rsquo;t have
liked it) before he came in, and let him know that she should never dare to
come to the place again, as his mother would tear her eyes out. Then she
checked herself. &ldquo;Of course she ain&rsquo;t your mother! How stupid I am!
I keep forgetting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had long since convinced himself that he had acquired a manner with
which he could meet allusions of this kind: he had had, first and last, so many
opportunities to practise it. Therefore he looked at his companion very
steadily while he said, &ldquo;My mother died many years ago; she was a great
invalid. But Pinnie has been awfully good to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s dead, too,&rdquo; Miss Henning remarked. &ldquo;She
died very suddenly. I dare say you remember her in the Place.&rdquo; Then,
while Hyacinth disengaged from the past the wavering figure of Mrs Henning, of
whom he mainly remembered that she used to strike him as dirty, the girl added,
smiling, but with more sentiment, &ldquo;But I have had no Pinnie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look as if you could take care of yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very confiding,&rdquo; said Millicent Henning. Then she
asked what had become of Mr Vetch. &ldquo;We used to say that if Miss Pynsent
was your mamma, he was your papa. In our family we used to call him Miss
Pynsent&rsquo;s young man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s her young man still,&rdquo; Hyacinth said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
our best friend&mdash;or supposed to be. He got me the place I&rsquo;m in now.
He lives by his fiddle, as he used to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millicent looked a little at her companion, after which she remarked, &ldquo;I
should have thought he would have got you a place at his theatre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At his theatre? That would have been no use. I don&rsquo;t play any
instrument.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean in the orchestra, you gaby! You would look very nice
in a fancy costume.&rdquo; She had her elbows on the table, and her shoulders
lifted, in an attitude of extreme familiarity. He was on the point of replying
that he didn&rsquo;t care for fancy costumes, he wished to go through life in
his own character; but he checked himself, with the reflection that this was
exactly what, apparently, he was destined not to do. His own character? He was
to cover that up as carefully as possible; he was to go through life in a mask,
in a borrowed mantle; he was to be, every day and every hour, an actor.
Suddenly, with the utmost irrelevance, Miss Henning inquired, &ldquo;Is Miss
Pynsent some relation? What gave her any right over you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had an answer ready for this question; he had determined to say, as he
had several times said before, &ldquo;Miss Pynsent is an old friend of my
family. My mother was very fond of her, and she was very fond of my
mother.&rdquo; He repeated the formula now, looking at Millicent with the same
inscrutable calmness (as he fancied), though what he would have liked to say to
her would have been that his mother was none of her business. But she was too
handsome to talk that way to, and she presented her large fair face to him,
across the table, with an air of solicitation to be cosy and comfortable. There
were things in his heart and a torment and a hidden passion in his life which
he should be glad enough to lay open to some woman. He believed that perhaps
this would be the cure ultimately; that in return for something he might drop,
syllable by syllable, into a listening feminine ear, certain other words would
be spoken to him which would make his pain for ever less sharp. But what woman
could he trust, what ear would be safe? The answer was not in this loud, fresh
laughing creature, whose sympathy couldn&rsquo;t have the fineness he was
looking for, since her curiosity was vulgar. Hyacinth objected to the vulgar as
much as Miss Pynsent herself; in this respect she had long since discovered
that he was after her own heart. He had not taken up the subject of Mrs
Henning&rsquo;s death; he felt himself incapable of inquiring about that lady,
and had no desire for knowledge of Millicent&rsquo;s relationships. Moreover he
always suffered, to sickness, when people began to hover about the question of
his origin, the reasons why Pinnie had had the care of him from a baby. Mrs
Henning had been untidy, but at least her daughter could speak of her.
&ldquo;Mr Vetch has changed his lodgings: he moved out of No. 17, three years
ago,&rdquo; he said, to vary the topic. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand the
other people in the house; there was a man that played the accordeon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millicent, however, was but moderately interested in this anecdote, and she
wanted to know why people should like Mr Vetch&rsquo;s fiddle any better. Then
she added, &ldquo;And I think that while he was about it he might have put you
into something better than a bookbinder&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t obliged to put me into anything. It&rsquo;s a very good
place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the same, it isn&rsquo;t where I should have looked to find
you,&rdquo; Millicent declared, not so much in the tone of wishing to pay him a
compliment as of resentment at having miscalculated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where should you have looked to find me? In the House of Commons?
It&rsquo;s a pity you couldn&rsquo;t have told me in advance what you would
have liked me to be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, over her cup, while she drank, in several sips. &ldquo;Do
you know what they used to say in the Place? That your father was a
lord.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely. That&rsquo;s the kind of rot they talk in that precious
hole,&rdquo; the young man said, without blenching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps he was,&rdquo; Millicent ventured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He may have been a prince, for all the good it has done me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy your talking as if you didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; said Millicent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Finish your tea&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind how I talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you <i>&rsquo;ave</i> got a temper!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed,
archly. &ldquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d be a clerk at a
banker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do they select them for their tempers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know what I mean. You used to be too clever to follow a
trade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not clever enough to live on air.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might be, really, for all the tea you drink! Why didn&rsquo;t you go
in for some high profession?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How was I to go in? Who the devil was to help me?&rdquo; Hyacinth
inquired, with a certain vibration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any relations?&rdquo; said Millicent, after a
moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing? Are you trying to make me swagger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he spoke sharply she only laughed, not in the least ruffled, and by the
way she looked at him seemed to like it. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry
you&rsquo;re only a journeyman,&rdquo; she went on, pushing away her cup.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined; but he called for the bill as if he
had been an employer of labour. Then, while it was being brought, he remarked
to his companion that he didn&rsquo;t believe she had an idea of what his work
was and how charming it could be. &ldquo;Yes, I get up books for the
shops,&rdquo; he said, when she had retorted that she perfectly understood.
&ldquo;But the art of the binder is an exquisite art.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So Miss Pynsent told me. She said you had some samples at home. I should
like to see them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know how good they are,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
He expected that she would exclaim, in answer, that he was an impudent wretch,
and for a moment she seemed to be on the point of doing so. But the words
changed on her lips, and she replied, almost tenderly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just
the way you used to speak to me, years ago in the Plice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about that. I hate all that time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, so do I, if you come to that,&rdquo; said Millicent, as if she could
rise to any breadth of view. And then she returned to her idea that he had not
done himself justice. &ldquo;You used always to be reading: I never thought you
would work with your &rsquo;ands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This seemed to irritate him, and, having paid the bill and given threepence,
ostentatiously, to the young woman with a languid manner and hair of an
unnatural yellow, who had waited on them, he said, &ldquo;You may depend upon
it I shan&rsquo;t do it an hour longer than I can help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will you do then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll see, some day.&rdquo; In the street, after they had
begun to walk again, he went on, &ldquo;You speak as if I could have my pick.
What was an obscure little beggar to do, buried in a squalid corner of London,
under a million of idiots? I had no help, no influence, no acquaintance of any
kind with professional people, and no means of getting at them. I had to do
something; I couldn&rsquo;t go on living on Pinnie. Thank God, I help her now,
a little. I took what I could get.&rdquo; He spoke as if he had been touched by
the imputation of having derogated.
</p>

<p>
Millicent seemed to imply that he defended himself successfully when she said,
&ldquo;You express yourself like a gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;a speech to which he
made no response. But he began to talk again afterwards, and, the evening
having definitely set in, his companion took his arm for the rest of the way
home. By the time he reached her door he had confided to her that, in secret,
he wrote: he had a dream of literary distinction. This appeared to impress her,
and she branched off to remark, with an irrelevance that characterised her,
that she didn&rsquo;t care anything about a man&rsquo;s family if she liked the
man himself; she thought families were played out. Hyacinth wished she would
leave his alone; and while they lingered in front of her house, before she went
in, he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt you&rsquo;re a jolly girl, and I am very happy to have
seen you again. But you have awfully little tact.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> have little tact? You should see me work off an old
jacket!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent a moment, standing before her with his hands in his pockets.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good job you&rsquo;re so handsome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millicent didn&rsquo;t blush at this compliment, and probably didn&rsquo;t
understand all it conveyed, but she looked into his eyes a while, with a smile
that showed her teeth, and then said, more inconsequently than ever,
&ldquo;Come now, who are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who am I? I&rsquo;m a wretched little bookbinder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I ever could fancy any one in that line!&rdquo;
Miss Henning exclaimed. Then she let him know that she couldn&rsquo;t ask him
in, as she made it a point not to receive gentlemen, but she didn&rsquo;t mind
if she took another walk with him and she didn&rsquo;t care if she met him
somewhere&mdash;if it were handy. As she lived so far from Lomax Place she
didn&rsquo;t care if she met him half-way. So, in the dusky by-street in
Pimlico, before separating, they took a casual tryst; the most interesting, the
young man felt, that had yet been&mdash;he could scarcely call it granted him.

<h3><a name="chap06"></a>VI</h3>

<p>
One day, shortly after this, at the bindery, his friend Poupin was absent, and
sent no explanation, as was customary in case of illness or domestic accident.
There were two or three men employed in the place whose non-appearance, usually
following close upon pay-day, was better unexplained, and was an implication of
moral feebleness; but as a general thing Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s establishment
was a haunt of punctuality and sobriety. Least of all had Eustache Poupin been
in the habit of asking for a margin. Hyacinth knew how little indulgence he had
ever craved, and this was part of his admiration for the extraordinary
Frenchman, an ardent stoic, a cold conspirator and an exquisite artist, who was
by far the most interesting person in the ranks of his acquaintance and whose
conversation, in the workshop, helped him sometimes to forget the smell of
leather and glue. His conversation! Hyacinth had had plenty of that, and had
endeared himself to the passionate refugee&mdash;Poupin had come to England
after the Commune of 1871, to escape the reprisals of the government of M.
Thiers, and had remained there in spite of amnesties and
rehabilitations&mdash;by the solemnity and candour of his attention. He was a
Republican of the old-fashioned sort, of the note of 1848, humanitary and
idealistic, infinitely addicted to fraternity and equality, and inexhaustibly
surprised and exasperated at finding so little enthusiasm for them in the land
of his exile. Poupin had a high claim upon Hyacinth&rsquo;s esteem and
gratitude, for he had been his godfather, his protector at the bindery. When
Anastasius Vetch found something for Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s <i>protégé</i> to do,
it was through the Frenchman, with whom he had accidentally formed an
acquaintance, that he found it.
</p>

<p>
When the boy was about fifteen years of age Mr Vetch made him a present of the
essays of Lord Bacon, and the purchase of this volume had important
consequences for Hyacinth. Anastasius Vetch was a poor man, and the luxury of
giving was for the most part denied him; but when once in a way he tasted it he
liked the sensation to be pure. No man knew better the difference between the
common and the rare, or was more capable of appreciating a book which opened
well&mdash;of which the margin was not hideously chopped and of which the
lettering on the back was sharp. It was only such a book that he could bring
himself to offer even to a poor little devil whom a fifth-rate dressmaker (he
knew Pinnie was fifth-rate) had rescued from the workhouse. So when it became a
question of fitting the great Elizabethan with a new coat&mdash;a coat of full
morocco, discreetly, delicately gilt&mdash;he went with his little cloth-bound
volume, a Pickering, straight to Mr Crookenden, whom every one that knew
anything about the matter knew to be a prince of binders, though they also knew
that his work, limited in quantity, was mainly done for a particular bookseller
and only through the latter&rsquo;s agency. Anastasius Vetch had no idea of
paying the bookseller&rsquo;s commission, and though he could be lavish (for
him) when he made a present, he was capable of taking an immense deal of
trouble to save sixpence. He made his way into Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s workshop,
which was situated in a small superannuated square in Soho, and where the
proposal of so slender a job was received at first with coldness. Mr Vetch,
however, insisted, and explained with irresistible frankness the motive of his
errand: the desire to obtain the best possible binding for the least possible
money. He made his conception of the best possible binding so vivid, so
exemplary, that the master of the shop at last confessed to that disinterested
sympathy which, under favouring circumstances, establishes itself between the
artist and the connoisseur. Mr Vetch&rsquo;s little book was put in hand as a
particular service to an eccentric gentleman whose visit had been a
smile-stirring interlude (for the circle of listening workmen) in a merely
mechanical day; and when he went back, three weeks later, to see whether it
were done, he had the pleasure of finding that his injunctions, punctually
complied with, had even been bettered. The work had been accomplished with a
perfection of skill which made him ask whom he was to thank for it (he had been
told that one man should do the whole of it), and in this manner he made the
acquaintance of the most brilliant craftsman in the establishment, the
incorruptible, the imaginative, the unerring Eustache Poupin.
</p>

<p>
In response to an appreciation which he felt not to be <i>banal</i> M. Poupin
remarked that he had at home a small collection of experiments in morocco,
Russia, parchment, of fanciful specimens with which, for the love of the art,
he had amused his leisure hours and which he should be happy to show his
interlocutor if the latter would do him the honour to call upon him at his
lodgings in Lisson Grove. Mr Vetch made a note of the address and, for the love
of the art, went one Sunday afternoon to see the binder&rsquo;s esoteric
studies. On this occasion he made the acquaintance of Madame Poupin, a small,
fat lady with a bristling moustache, the white cap of an <i>ouvrière</i>, a
knowledge of her husband&rsquo;s craft that was equal to his own, and not a
syllable of English save the words, &ldquo;What you think, what you
think?&rdquo; which she introduced with startling frequency. He also discovered
that his new acquaintance had been a political proscript and that he regarded
the iniquitous fabric of Church and State with an eye scarcely more reverent
than the fiddler&rsquo;s own. M. Poupin was a socialist, which Anastasius Vetch
was not, and a constructive democrat (instead of being a mere scoffer at effete
things) and a theorist and an optimist and a visionary; he believed that the
day was to come when all the nations of the earth would abolish their frontiers
and armies and custom-houses, and embrace on both cheeks, and cover the globe
with boulevards, radiating from Paris, where the human family would sit, in
groups, at little tables, according to affinities, drinking coffee (not tea,
<i>par exemple!</i>) and listening to the music of the spheres. Mr Vetch
neither prefigured nor desired this organised felicity; he was fond of his cup
of tea, and only wanted to see the British constitution a good deal simplified;
he thought it a much overrated system, but his heresies rubbed shoulders,
sociably, with those of the little bookbinder, and his friend in Lisson Grove
became for him the type of the intelligent foreigner whose conversation
completes our culture. Poupin&rsquo;s humanitary zeal was as unlimited as his
English vocabulary was the reverse, and the new friends agreed with each other
enough, and not too much, to discuss, which was much better than an unspeakable
harmony. On several other Sunday afternoons the fiddler went back to Lisson
Grove, and having, at his theatre, as a veteran, a faithful servant, an
occasional privilege, he was able to carry thither, one day in the autumn, an
order for two seats in the second balcony. Madame Poupin and her husband passed
a lugubrious evening at the English comedy, where they didn&rsquo;t understand
a word that was spoken, and consoled themselves by gazing at their friend in
the orchestra. But this adventure did not arrest the development of a
friendship into which, eventually, Amanda Pynsent was drawn. Madame Poupin,
among the cold insularies, lacked female society, and Mr Vetch proposed to his
amiable friend in Lomax Place to call upon her. The little dressmaker, who in
the course of her life had known no Frenchwoman but the unhappy Florentine (so
favourable a specimen till she began to go wrong), adopted his suggestion, in
the hope that she should get a few ideas from a lady whose appearance would
doubtless exemplify (as Florentine&rsquo;s originally had done) the fine taste
of her nation; but she found the bookbinder and his wife a bewildering mixture
of the brilliant and the relaxed, and was haunted, long afterwards, by the
memory of the lady&rsquo;s calico jacket, her uncorseted form and her carpet
slippers.
</p>

<p>
The acquaintance, none the less, was sealed three months later by a supper, one
Sunday night, in Lisson Grove, to which Mr Vetch brought his fiddle, at which
Amanda presented to her hosts her adoptive son, and which also revealed to her
that Madame Poupin could dress a Michaelmas goose, if she couldn&rsquo;t dress
a fat Frenchwoman. This lady confided to the fiddler that she thought Miss
Pynsent exceedingly <i>comme il faut&mdash;dans le genre anglais;</i> and
neither Amanda nor Hyacinth had ever passed an evening of such splendour. It
took its place, in the boy&rsquo;s recollection, beside the visit, years
before, to Mr Vetch&rsquo;s theatre. He drank in the conversation which passed
between that gentleman and M. Poupin. M. Poupin showed him his bindings, the
most precious trophies of his skill, and it seemed to Hyacinth that on the spot
he was initiated into a fascinating mystery. He handled the books for half an
hour; Anastasius Vetch watched him, without giving any particular sign. When,
therefore, presently, Miss Pynsent consulted her friend for the twentieth time
on the subject of Hyacinth&rsquo;s &lsquo;career&rsquo;&mdash;she spoke as if
she were hesitating between the diplomatic service, the army and the
church&mdash;the fiddler replied with promptitude, &ldquo;Make him, if you can,
what the Frenchman is.&rdquo; At the mention of a handicraft poor Pinnie always
looked very solemn, yet when Mr Vetch asked her if she were prepared to send
the boy to one of the universities, or to pay the premium required for his
being articled to a solicitor, or to make favour, on his behalf, with a
bank-director or a mighty merchant, or, yet again, to provide him with a
comfortable home while he should woo the muse and await the laurels of
literature&mdash;when, I say, he put the case before her with this cynical,
ironical lucidity, she only sighed and said that all the money she had ever
saved was ninety pounds, which, as he knew perfectly well, it would cost her
his acquaintance for evermore to take out of the bank. The fiddler had, in
fact, declared to her in a manner not to be mistaken that if she should divest
herself, on the boy&rsquo;s account, of this sole nest-egg of her old age, he
would wash his hands of her and her affairs. Her standard of success for
Hyacinth was vague, save on one point, as regards which she was passionately,
fiercely firm; she was perfectly determined he should never go into a small
shop. She would rather see him a bricklayer or a costermonger than dedicated to
a retail business, tying up candles at a grocer&rsquo;s, or giving change for a
shilling across a counter. She would rather, she declared on one occasion, see
him articled to a shoemaker or a tailor.
</p>

<p>
A stationer in a neighbouring street had affixed to his window a written notice
that he was in want of a smart errand-boy, and Pinnie, on hearing of it, had
presented Hyacinth to his consideration. The stationer was a dreadful bullying
man, with a patch over his eye, who seemed to think the boy would be richly
remunerated with three shillings a week; a contemptible measure, as it seemed
to the dressmaker, of his rare abilities and acquirements. His schooling had
been desultory, precarious, and had had a certain continuity mainly in his
early years, while he was under the care of an old lady who combined with the
functions of pew-opener at a neighbouring church the manipulation, in the Place
itself, where she resided with her sister, a monthly nurse, of such pupils as
could be spared (in their families) from the more urgent exercise of holding
the baby and fetching the beer. Later, for a twelvemonth, Pinnie had paid five
shillings a week for him at an &lsquo;Academy&rsquo; in a genteel part of
Islington, where there was an &lsquo;instructor in the foreign
languages&rsquo;, a platform for oratory, and a high social standard, but where
Hyacinth suffered from the fact that almost all his mates were the sons of
dealers in edible articles&mdash;pastry-cooks, grocers and
fishmongers&mdash;and in this capacity subjected him to pangs and ignominious
contrasts by bringing to school, for their exclusive consumption, or for
exchange and barter, various buns, oranges, spices, and marine animals, which
the boy, with his hands in his empty pockets and the sense of a savourless home
in his heart, was obliged to see devoured without his participation. Miss
Pynsent would not have pretended that he was highly educated, in the technical
sense of the word, but she believed that at fifteen he had read almost every
book in the world. The limits of his reading were, in fact, only the limits of
his opportunity. Mr Vetch, who talked with him more and more as he grew older,
knew this, and lent him every volume he possessed or could pick up for the
purpose. Reading was his happiness, and the absence of any direct contact with
a library his principal source of discontent; that is, of that part of his
discontent which he could speak out. Mr Vetch knew that he was really clever,
and therefore thought it a woful pity that he could not have furtherance in
some liberal walk; but he would have thought it a greater pity still that so
bright a lad should be condemned to measure tape or cut slices of cheese. He
himself had no influence which he could bring into play, no connection with the
great world of capital or the market of labour. That is, he touched these
mighty institutions at but one very small point&mdash;a point which, such as it
was, he kept well in mind.
</p>

<p>
When Pinnie replied to the stationer round the corner, after he had mentioned
the &lsquo;terms&rsquo; on which he was prepared to receive applications from
errand-boys, that, thank heaven, she hadn&rsquo;t sunk so low as that&mdash;so
low as to sell her darling into slavery for three shillings a week&mdash;he
felt that she only gave more florid expression to his own sentiment. Of course,
if Hyacinth did not begin by carrying parcels he could not hope to be promoted,
through the more refined nimbleness of tying them up, to a position as
accountant or bookkeeper; but both the fiddler and his friend&mdash;Miss
Pynsent, indeed, only in the last resort&mdash;resigned themselves to the
forfeiture of this prospect. Mr Vetch saw clearly that a charming handicraft
was a finer thing than a vulgar &lsquo;business&rsquo;, and one day, after his
acquaintance with Eustache Poupin had gone a considerable length, he inquired
of the Frenchman whether there would be a chance of the lad&rsquo;s obtaining a
footing, under his own wing, in Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s workshop. There could be
no better place for him to acquire a knowledge of the most delightful of the
mechanical arts; and to be received into such an establishment, and at the
instance of such an artist, would be a real start in life. M. Poupin meditated,
and that evening confided his meditations to the companion who reduplicated all
his thoughts and understood him better even than he understood himself. The
pair had no children, and had felt the defect; moreover, they had heard from Mr
Vetch the dolorous tale of the boy&rsquo;s entrance into life. He was one of
the disinherited, one of the expropriated, one of the exceptionally
interesting; and, moreover he was one of themselves, a child, as it were, of
France, an offshoot of the sacred race. It is not the most authenticated point
in this veracious history, but there is strong reason to believe that tears
were shed that night, in Lisson Grove, over poor little Hyacinth Robinson. In a
day or two M. Poupin replied to the fiddler that he had now been several years
in Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s employ; that during that time he had done work for him
that he would have had <i>bien du mal</i> to get done by another, and had never
asked for an indulgence, an allowance, a remission, an augmentation. It was
time, if only for the dignity of the thing, he should ask for something, and he
would make their little friend the subject of his demand. &ldquo;<i>La société
lui doit bien cela</i>,&rdquo; he remarked afterwards, when, Mr Crookenden
proving drily hospitable and the arrangement being formally complete, Mr Vetch
thanked him, in his kindly, casual, bashful English way. He was paternal when
Hyacinth began to occupy a place in the malodorous chambers in Soho; he took
him in hand, made him a disciple, the recipient of a precious tradition,
discovered in him a susceptibility to philosophic as well as technic truth. He
taught him French and socialism, encouraged him to spend his evenings in Lisson
Grove, invited him to regard Madame Poupin as a second, or rather as a third,
mother, and in short made a very considerable mark on the boy&rsquo;s mind. He
elicited the latent Gallicism of his nature, and by the time he was twenty
Hyacinth, who had completely assimilated his influence, regarded him with a
mixture of veneration and amusement. M. Poupin was the person who consoled him
most when he was miserable; and he was very often miserable.
</p>

<p>
His staying away from his work was so rare that, in the afternoon, before he
went home, Hyacinth walked to Lisson Grove to see what ailed him. He found his
friend in bed, with a plaster on his chest, and Madame Poupin making
<i>tisane</i> over the fire. The Frenchman took his indisposition solemnly but
resignedly, like a man who believed that all illness was owing to the imperfect
organisation of society, and lay covered up to his chin, with a red cotton
handkerchief bound round his head. Near his bed sat a visitor, a young man
unknown to Hyacinth. Hyacinth, naturally, had never been to Paris, but he
always supposed that the <i>intérieur</i> of his friends in Lisson Grove gave
rather a vivid idea of that city. The two small rooms which constituted their
establishment contained a great many mirrors, as well as little portraits
(old-fashioned prints) of revolutionary heroes. The chimney-piece, in the
bedroom, was muffled in some red drapery, which appeared to Hyacinth
extraordinarily magnificent; the principal ornament of the salon was a group of
small and highly-decorated cups, on a tray, accompanied by gilt bottles and
glasses, the latter still more diminutive&mdash;the whole intended for black
coffee and liqueurs. There was no carpet on the floor, but rugs and mats, of
various shapes and sizes, disposed themselves at the feet of the chairs and
sofas; and in the sitting-room, where there was a wonderful gilt clock, of the
Empire, surmounted with a &lsquo;subject&rsquo; representing Virtue receiving a
crown of laurel from the hands of Faith, Madame Poupin, with the aid of a tiny
stove, a handful of charcoal, and two or three saucepans, carried on a
triumphant <i>cuisine</i>. In the windows were curtains of white muslin, much
fluted and frilled, and tied with pink ribbon.

<p>
&ldquo;I am suffering extremely, but we must all suffer, so long as the social
question is so abominably, so iniquitously neglected,&rdquo; Poupin remarked,
speaking French and rolling toward Hyacinth his salient, excited-looking eyes,
which always had the same proclaiming, challenging expression, whatever his
occupation or his topic. Hyacinth had seated himself near his friend&rsquo;s
pillow, opposite the strange young man, who had been accommodated with a chair
at the foot of the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes; with their filthy politics the situation of the <i>pauvre
monde</i> is the last thing they ever think of!&rdquo; his wife exclaimed, from
the fire. &ldquo;There are times when I ask myself how long it will go
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will go on till the measure of their imbecility, their infamy, is
full. It will go on till the day of justice, till the reintegration of the
despoiled and disinherited, is ushered in with an irresistible force.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we always see things go on; we never see them change,&rdquo; said
Madame Poupin, making a very cheerful clatter with a big spoon in a saucepan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We may not see it, but <i>they&rsquo;ll</i> see it,&rdquo; her husband
rejoined. &ldquo;But what do I say, my children? I do see it,&rdquo; he
pursued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s before my eyes, in its luminous reality, especially
as I lie here&mdash;the revendication, the rehabilitation, the
rectification.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth ceased to pay attention, not because he had a differing opinion about
what M. Poupin called the <i>avènement</i> of the disinherited, but, on the
contrary, precisely on account of his familiarity with that prospect. It was
the constant theme of his French friends, whom he had long since perceived to
be in a state of chronic spiritual inflammation. For them the social question
was always in order, the political question always abhorrent, the disinherited
always present. He wondered at their zeal, their continuity, their vivacity,
their incorruptibility; at the abundant supply of conviction and prophecy which
they always had on hand. He believed that at bottom he was sorer than they, yet
he had deviations and lapses, moments when the social question bored him and he
forgot not only his own wrongs, which would have been pardonable, but those of
the people at large, of his brothers and sisters in misery. They, however, were
perpetually in the breach, and perpetually consistent with themselves and, what
is more, with each other. Hyacinth had heard that the institution of marriage
in France was rather lightly considered, but he was struck with the closeness
and intimacy of the union in Lisson Grove, the passionate identity of interest:
especially on the day when M. Poupin informed him, in a moment of extreme but
not indiscreet expansion, that the lady was his wife only in a spiritual,
transcendental sense. There were hypocritical concessions and debasing
superstitions of which this exalted pair wholly disapproved. Hyacinth knew
their vocabulary by heart, and could have said everything, in the same words,
that on any given occasion M. Poupin was likely to say. He knew that
&lsquo;they&rsquo;, in their phraseology, was a comprehensive allusion to every
one in the world but the people&mdash;though who, exactly, in their length and
breadth, the people were was less definitely established. He himself was of
this sacred body, for which the future was to have such compensations; and so,
of course, were the Frenchman and his consort, and so was Pinnie, and so were
most of the inhabitants of Lomax Place and the workmen in old
Crookenden&rsquo;s shop. But was old Crookenden himself, who wore an apron
rather dirtier than the rest of them and was a master-hand at
&lsquo;forwarding&rsquo;, but who, on the other side, was the occupant of a
villa almost detached, in Putney, with a wife known to have secret aspirations
toward a page in buttons? Above all, was Mr Vetch, who earned a weekly wage,
and not a large one, with his fiddle, but who had mysterious affinities of
another sort, reminiscences of a phase in which he smoked cigars, had a hat-box
and used cabs&mdash;besides visiting Boulogne? Anastasius Vetch had interfered
in his life, atrociously, in a terrible crisis; but Hyacinth, who strove to
cultivate justice in his own conduct, believed he had acted conscientiously and
tried to esteem him, the more so as the fiddler evidently felt that he had
something to make up to him and had treated him with marked benevolence for
years. He believed, in short, that Mr Vetch took a sincere interest in him, and
if he should meddle again would meddle in a different way: he used to see him
sometimes looking at him with the kindest eyes. It would make a difference,
therefore, whether he were of the people or not, inasmuch as in the day of the
great revenge it would only be the people who should be saved. It was for the
people the world was made: whoever was not of them was against them; and all
others were cumberers, usurpers, exploiters, <i>accapareurs</i>, as M. Poupin
used to say. Hyacinth had once put the question directly to Mr Vetch, who
looked at him a while through the fumes of his eternal pipe and then said,
&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m an aristocrat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know but you were a <i>bourgeois</i>,&rdquo; the young
man answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m neither. I&rsquo;m a Bohemian.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With your evening dress, every night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said the fiddler, &ldquo;those are the most
confirmed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was only half satisfied with this, for it was by no means definite to
him that Bohemians were also to be saved; if he could be sure, perhaps he would
become one himself. Yet he never suspected Mr Vetch of being a
&lsquo;spy&rsquo;, though Eustache Poupin had told him that there were a great
many who looked a good deal like that: not, of course, with any purpose of
incriminating the fiddler, whom he had trusted from the first and continued to
trust. The middle-class spy became a very familiar type to Hyacinth, and though
he had never caught one of the infamous brotherhood in the act, there were
plenty of persons to whom, on the very face of the matter, he had no hesitation
in attributing the character. There was nothing of the Bohemian, at any rate,
about the Poupins, whom Hyacinth had now known long enough not to be surprised
at the way they combined the socialistic passion, a red-hot impatience for the
general rectification, with an extraordinary decency of life and a worship of
proper work. The Frenchman spoke, habitually, as if the great swindle practised
upon the people were too impudent to be endured a moment longer, and yet he
found patience for the most exquisite &lsquo;tooling&rsquo;, and took a book in
hand with the deliberation of one who should believe that everything was
immutably constituted. Hyacinth knew what he thought of priests and theologies,
but he had the religion of conscientious craftsmanship, and he reduced the boy,
on his side, to a kind of prostration before his delicate, wonder-working
fingers. &ldquo;What will you have? <i>J&rsquo;ai la main
parisienne</i>,&rdquo; M. Poupin would reply modestly, when Hyacinth&rsquo;s
admiration broke out; and he was good enough, after he had seen a few specimens
of what our hero could do, to inform him that <i>he</i> had the same happy
conformation. &ldquo;There is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t be a good
workman, <i>il n&rsquo;y a que ça;</i>&rdquo; and his own life was practically
governed by this conviction. He delighted in the use of his hands and his tools
and the exercise of his taste, which was faultless, and Hyacinth could easily
imagine how it must torment him to spend a day on his back. He ended by
perceiving, however, that consolation was, on this occasion, in some degree
conveyed by the presence of the young man who sat at the foot of the bed, and
with whom M. Poupin exhibited such signs of acquaintance as to make our hero
wonder why he had not seen him before, nor even heard of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by an irresistible force?&rdquo; the young man
inquired, leaning back in his chair, with raised arms and his interlocked hands
behind him, supporting his head. M. Poupin had spoken French, which he always
preferred to do, the insular tongue being an immense tribulation to him; but
his visitor spoke English, and Hyacinth immediately perceived that there was
nothing French about <i>him</i>&mdash;M. Poupin could never tell him he had
<i>la main parisienne</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean a force that will make the bourgeois go down into their cellars
and hide, pale with fear, behind their barrels of wine and their heaps of
gold!&rdquo; cried M. Poupin, rolling terrible eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And in this country, I hope in their coal-bins. <i>Là-là</i>, we shall
find them even there,&rdquo; his wife remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;89 was an irresistible force,&rdquo; said M. Poupin. &ldquo;I
believe you would have thought so if you had been there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so was the entrance of the Versaillais, which sent you over here,
ten years ago,&rdquo; the young man rejoined. He saw that Hyacinth was watching
him, and he met his eyes, smiling a little, in a way that added to our
hero&rsquo;s interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardon, pardon</i>, I resist!&rdquo; cried Eustache Poupin, glaring,
in his improvised nightcap, out of his sheets; and Madame repeated that they
resisted&mdash;she believed well that they resisted! The young man burst out
laughing; whereupon his host declared, with a dignity which even his recumbent
position did not abate, that it was really frivolous of him to ask such
questions as that, knowing as he did&mdash;what he did know.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;I know,&rdquo; said the young man, good-naturedly,
lowering his arms and thrusting his hands into his pockets, while he stretched
his long legs a little. &ldquo;But everything is yet to be tried.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the trial will be on a great scale&mdash;<i>soyez tranquille!</i> It
will be one of those experiments that constitute a proof.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth wondered what they were talking about, and perceived that it must be
something important, for the stranger was not a man who would take an interest
in anything else. Hyacinth was immensely struck with him&mdash;he could see
that he was remarkable&mdash;and felt slightly aggrieved that he should be a
stranger: that is, that he should be, apparently, a familiar of Lisson Grove
and yet that M. Poupin should not have thought his young friend from Lomax
Place worthy, up to this time, to be made acquainted with him. I know not to
what degree the visitor in the other chair discovered these reflections in
Hyacinth&rsquo;s face, but after a moment, looking across at him, he said in a
friendly yet just slightly diffident way, a way our hero liked, &ldquo;And do
you know, too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I know what?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, wondering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if you did, you would!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed, laughing
again. Such a rejoinder, from any one else, would have irritated our sensitive
hero, but it only made Hyacinth more curious about his interlocutor, whose
laugh was loud and extraordinarily gay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mon ami</i>, you ought to present <i>ces messieurs</i>,&rdquo; Madame
Poupin remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ah ça</i>, is that the way you trifle with state secrets?&rdquo; her
husband cried out, without heeding her. Then he went on, in a different tone:
&ldquo; M. Hyacinthe is a gifted child, <i>un enfant très-doué</i>, in whom I
take a tender interest&mdash;a child who has an account to settle. Oh, a
thumping big one! Isn&rsquo;t it so, <i>mon petit?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was very well meant, but it made Hyacinth blush, and, without knowing
exactly what to say, he murmured shyly, &ldquo;Oh, I only want them to let me
alone!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is very young,&rdquo; said Eustache Poupin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is the person we have seen in this country whom we like the
best,&rdquo; his wife added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you are French,&rdquo; suggested the strange young man.
</p>

<p>
The trio seemed to Hyacinth to be waiting for his answer to this; it was as if
a listening stillness had fallen upon them. He found it a difficult moment,
partly because there was something exciting and embarrassing in the attention
of the other visitor, and partly because he had never yet had to decide that
important question. He didn&rsquo;t really know whether he were French or
English, or which of the two he should prefer to be. His mother&rsquo;s blood,
her suffering in an alien land, the unspeakable, irremediable misery that
consumed her, in a place, among a people, she must have execrated&mdash;all
this made him French; yet he was conscious at the same time of qualities that
did not mix with it. He had evolved, long ago, a legend about his mother, built
it up slowly, adding piece to piece, in passionate musings and broodings, when
his cheeks burned and his eyes filled; but there were times when it wavered and
faded, when it ceased to console him and he ceased to trust it. He had had a
father too, and his father had suffered as well, and had fallen under a blow,
and had paid with his life; and him also he felt in his mind and his body, when
the effort to think it out did not simply end in darkness and confusion,
challenging still even while they baffled, and inevitable freezing horror. At
any rate, he seemed rooted in the place where his wretched parents had
expiated, and he knew nothing about any other. Moreover, when old Poupin said,
&lsquo;M. Hyacinthe&rsquo;, as he had often done before, he didn&rsquo;t
altogether enjoy it; he thought it made his name, which he liked well enough in
English, sound like the name of a hairdresser. Our young friend was under a
cloud and a stigma, but he was not yet prepared to admit that he was
ridiculous. &ldquo;Oh, I dare say I ain&rsquo;t anything,&rdquo; he replied in
a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>En v&rsquo;là des bêtises!</i>&rdquo; cried Madame Poupin. &ldquo;Do
you mean to say you are not as good as any one in the world? I should like to
see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We all have an account to settle, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; said the
strange young man.
</p>

<p>
He evidently meant this to be encouraging to Hyacinth, whose quick desire to
avert M. Poupin&rsquo;s allusions had not been lost upon him; but our hero
could see that he himself would be sure to be one of the first to be paid. He
would make society bankrupt, but he would be paid. He was tall and fair and
good-natured looking, but you couldn&rsquo;t tell&mdash;or at least Hyacinth
couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;whether he were handsome or ugly, with his large head and
square forehead, his thick, straight hair, his heavy mouth and rather vulgar
nose, his admirably clear, bright eye, light-coloured and set very deep; for
though there was a want of fineness in some of its parts, his face had a marked
expression of intelligence and resolution, and denoted a kind of joyous moral
health. He was dressed like a workman in his Sunday toggery, having evidently
put on his best to call in Lisson Grove, where he was to meet a lady, and
wearing in particular a necktie which was both cheap and pretentious, and of
which Hyacinth, who noticed everything of that kind, observed the crude, false
blue. He had very big shoes&mdash;the shoes, almost, of a country
labourer&mdash;and spoke with a provincial accent, which Hyacinth believed to
be that of Lancashire. This didn&rsquo;t suggest cleverness, but it
didn&rsquo;t prevent Hyacinth from perceiving that he was the reverse of
stupid; that he probably, indeed, had a tremendous head. Our little hero had a
great desire to know superior people, and he interested himself on the spot in
this strong, humorous fellow, who had the complexion of a ploughboy and the
glance of a commander-in-chief and who might have been (Hyacinth thought) a
distinguished young <i>savant</i> in the disguise of an artisan. The disguise
would have been very complete, for he had several brown stains on his fingers.
Hyacinth&rsquo;s curiosity, on this occasion, was both excited and gratified;
for after two or three allusions, which he didn&rsquo;t understand, had been
made to a certain place where Poupin and the stranger had met and expected to
meet again, Madame Poupin exclaimed that it was a shame not to take in M.
Hyacinthe, who, she would answer for it, had in him the making of one of the
pure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All in good time, in good time, <i>ma bonne</i>,&rdquo; the invalid
replied. &ldquo;M. Hyacinthe knows that I count upon him, whether or no I make
him an <i>interne</i> to-day or wait a while longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by an <i>interne?</i>&rdquo; Hyacinth asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, what shall I say!&rdquo; and Eustache Poupin stared at
him solemnly, from his pillow. &ldquo;You are very sympathetic, but I am afraid
you are too young.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One is never too young to contribute one&rsquo;s <i>obole</i>,&rdquo;
said Madame Poupin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you keep a secret?&rdquo; asked the other visitor, smilingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it a plot&mdash;a conspiracy?&rdquo; Hyacinth broke out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He asks that as if he were asking if it&rsquo;s a plum-pudding,&rdquo;
said M. Poupin. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t good to eat, and we don&rsquo;t do it for
our amusement. It&rsquo;s terribly serious, my child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of society, to which he and I and a good many others
belong. There is no harm in telling him that,&rdquo; the young man went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I advise you not to tell it to Mademoiselle; she is quite in the old
ideas,&rdquo; Madame Poupin suggested to Hyacinth, tasting her <i>tisane</i>.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth sat baffled and wondering, looking from his fellow-labourer in Soho to
his new acquaintance opposite. &ldquo;If you have some plan, something to which
one can give one&rsquo;s self, I think you might have told me,&rdquo; he
remarked, in a moment, to Poupin.
</p>

<p>
The latter merely gazed at him a while; then he said to the strange young man,
&ldquo;He is a little jealous of you. But there is no harm in that; it&rsquo;s
of his age. You must know him, you must like him. We will tell you his history
some other day; it will make you feel that he belongs to us in fact. It is an
accident that he hasn&rsquo;t met you here before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could <i>ces messieurs</i> have met, when M. Paul never comes? He
doesn&rsquo;t spoil us!&rdquo; Madame Poupin cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see I have my little sister at home to take care of, when I
ain&rsquo;t at the shop,&rdquo; M. Paul explained. &ldquo;This afternoon it was
just a chance; there was a lady we know came in to sit with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lady&mdash;a real lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, every inch,&rdquo; said M. Paul, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like them to thrust themselves into your apartment like that,
because you have the <i>désagrément</i> of being poor? It seems to be the
custom in this country, but it wouldn&rsquo;t suit me at all,&rdquo; Madame
Poupin continued. &ldquo;I should like to see one of <i>ces dames</i>&mdash;the
real ones&mdash;coming in to sit with me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are not a cripple; you have got the use of your legs!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and of my arms!&rdquo; cried the Frenchwoman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This lady looks after several others in our court, and she reads to my
sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, you are patient, you English.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall never do anything without that,&rdquo; said M. Paul, with
undisturbed good-humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are perfectly right; you can&rsquo;t say that too often. It will be
a tremendous job, and only the strong will prevail,&rdquo; his host murmured, a
little wearily, turning his eyes to Madame Poupin, who approached slowly,
holding the <i>tisane</i> in a rather full bowl, and tasting it again and yet
again as she came.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had been watching his fellow-visitor with deepening interest; a fact
of which M. Paul apparently became aware, for he said, presently, giving a
little nod in the direction of the bed, &ldquo;He says we ought to know each
other. I&rsquo;m sure I have nothing against it. I like to know folk, when
they&rsquo;re worth it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was too pleased with this even to take it up; it seemed to him, for a
moment, that he couldn&rsquo;t touch it gracefully enough. But he said, with
sufficient eagerness, &ldquo;Will you tell me all about your plot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no plot. I don&rsquo;t think I care much for
plots.&rdquo; And with his mild, steady, light-blue English eye, M. Paul
certainly had not much the appearance of a conspirator.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a new era?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, rather disappointed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s just a little movement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ah bien, voilà du propre;</i> between us we have thrown him into a
fever!&rdquo; cried Madame Poupin, who had put down her bowl on a table near
her husband&rsquo;s bed and was bending over him, with her hand on his
forehead. Eustache was flushed, he had closed his eyes, and it was evident
there had been more than enough conversation. Madame Poupin announced as much,
with the addition that if the young men wished to make acquaintance they must
do it outside; the invalid must be perfectly quiet. They accordingly withdrew,
with apologies and promises to return for further news on the morrow, and two
minutes afterward Hyacinth found himself standing face to face with his new
friend on the pavement in front of M. Poupin&rsquo;s residence, under a
street-lamp which struggled ineffectually with the brown winter dusk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that your name&mdash;M. Paul?&rdquo; he asked, looking up at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, bless you, no; that&rsquo;s only her Frenchified way of putting it.
My name <i>is</i> Paul, though&mdash;Paul Muniment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your trade?&rdquo; Hyacinth demanded, with a jump into
familiarity; for his companion seemed to have told him a great deal more than
was usually conveyed in that item of information.
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment looked down at him from above broad shoulders. &ldquo;I work at a
wholesale chemist&rsquo;s, at Lambeth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where do you live?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I live over the water, too; in the far south of London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And are you going home now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I am going to toddle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And may I toddle with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Muniment considered him further; then he gave a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
carry you, if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you; I expect I can walk as far as you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I admire your spirit, and I dare say I shall like your
company.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something in his face, taken in connection with the idea that he was
concerned in a little movement, which made Hyacinth feel the desire to go with
him till he dropped; and in a moment they started away together and took the
direction Muniment had mentioned. They discoursed as they went, and exchanged a
great many opinions and anecdotes; but they reached the south-westerly court in
which the young chemist lived with his infirm sister before he had told
Hyacinth anything definite about his little movement, or Hyacinth, on his side,
had related to him the circumstances connected with his being, according to M.
Poupin, one of the disinherited. Hyacinth didn&rsquo;t wish to press him; he
would not for the world have appeared to him indiscreet; and, moreover, though
he had taken so great a fancy to Muniment, he was not quite prepared, as yet,
to be pressed. Therefore it did not become very clear to him how his companion
had made Poupin&rsquo;s acquaintance and how long he had enjoyed it. Paul
Muniment nevertheless was to a certain extent communicative about himself, and
forewarned Hyacinth that he lived in a very poor little corner. He had his
sister to keep&mdash;she could do nothing for herself; and he paid a low rent
because she had to have doctors, and doses, and all sorts of little comforts.
He spent a shilling a week for her on flowers. It was better, too, when you got
upstairs, and from the back windows you could see the dome of St Paul&rsquo;s.
Audley Court, with its pretty name, which reminded Hyacinth of Tennyson, proved
to be a still dingier nook than Lomax Place; and it had the further drawback
that you had to pass through a narrow alley, a passage between high, black
walls, to enter it. At the door of one of the houses the young men paused,
lingering a little, and then Muniment said, &ldquo;I say, why shouldn&rsquo;t
you come up? I like you well enough for that, and you can see my sister; her
name is Rosy.&rdquo; He spoke as if this would be a great privilege, and added,
humorously, that Rosy enjoyed a call from a gentleman, of all things. Hyacinth
needed no urging, and he groped his way, at his companion&rsquo;s heels, up a
dark staircase, which appeared to him&mdash;for they stopped only when they
could go no further&mdash;the longest and steepest he had ever ascended. At the
top Paul Muniment pushed open a door, but exclaimed, &ldquo;Hullo, have you
gone to roost?&rdquo; on perceiving that the room on the threshold of which
they stood was unlighted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, no; we are sitting in the dark,&rdquo; a small, bright voice
instantly replied. &ldquo;Lady Aurora is so kind; she&rsquo;s here
still.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The voice came out of a corner so pervaded by gloom that the speaker was
indistinguishable. &ldquo;Dear me, that&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; Paul Muniment
rejoined. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a party, then, for I have brought some one
else. We are poor, you know, but I dare say we can manage a candle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this, in the dim firelight, Hyacinth saw a tall figure erect itself&mdash;a
figure angular and slim, crowned with a large, vague hat, surmounted,
apparently, with a flowing veil. This unknown person gave a singular laugh, and
said, &ldquo;Oh, I brought some candles; we could have had a light if we had
wished it.&rdquo; Both the tone and the purport of the words announced to
Hyacinth that they proceeded from the lips of Lady Aurora.

<p>
Paul Muniment took a match out of his pocket and lighted it on the sole of his
shoe; after which he applied it to a tallow candle which stood in a tin
receptacle on the low mantel-shelf. This enabled Hyacinth to perceive a narrow
bed in a corner, and a small figure stretched upon it&mdash;a figure revealed
to him mainly by the bright fixedness of a pair of large eyes, of which the
whites were sharply contrasted with the dark pupil, and which gazed at him
across a counterpane of gaudy patchwork. The brown room seemed crowded with
heterogeneous objects, and had, moreover, for Hyacinth, thanks to a multitude
of small prints, both plain and coloured, fastened all over the walls, a
highly-decorated appearance. The little person in the corner had the air of
having gone to bed in a picture-gallery, and as soon as Hyacinth became aware
of this his impression deepened that Paul Muniment and his sister were very
remarkable people. Lady Aurora hovered before him with a kind of drooping
erectness, laughing a good deal, vaguely and shyly, as if there were something
rather awkward in her being found still on the premises. &ldquo;Rosy, girl,
I&rsquo;ve brought you a visitor,&rdquo; Paul Muniment said. &ldquo;This young
man has walked all the way from Lisson Grove to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
Rosy continued to look at Hyacinth from over her counterpane, and he felt
slightly embarrassed, for he had never yet been presented to a young lady in
her position. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind her being in bed&mdash;she&rsquo;s
always in bed,&rdquo; her brother went on. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in bed just the
same as a little trout is in the water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, if I didn&rsquo;t receive company because I was in bed, there
wouldn&rsquo;t be much use, would there, Lady Aurora?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rosy made this inquiry in a light, gay tone, darting her brilliant eyes at her
companion, who replied instantly, with still greater hilarity, and in a voice
which struck Hyacinth as strange and affected, &ldquo;Oh, dear, no, it seems
quite the natural place!&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s such a
pretty bed, such a comfortable bed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed it is, when your ladyship makes it up,&rdquo; said Rosy; while
Hyacinth wondered at this strange phenomenon of a peer&rsquo;s daughter (for he
knew she must be that) performing the functions of a housemaid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, now, you haven&rsquo;t been doing that again to-day?&rdquo;
Muniment asked, punching the mattress of the invalid with a vigorous hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray, who would, if I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Lady Aurora inquired.
&ldquo;It only takes a minute, if one knows how.&rdquo; Her manner was jocosely
apologetic, and she seemed to plead guilty to having been absurd; in the dim
light Hyacinth thought he saw her blush, as if she were much embarrassed. In
spite of her blushing, her appearance and manner suggested to him a personage
in a comedy. She sounded the letter <i>r</i> peculiarly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can do it, beautifully. I often do it, when Mrs Major doesn&rsquo;t
come up,&rdquo; Paul Muniment said, continuing to thump his sister&rsquo;s
couch in an appreciative but somewhat subversive manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have no doubt whatever!&rdquo; Lady Aurora exclaimed, quickly.
&ldquo;Mrs Major must have so very much to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the making-up of beds, I&rsquo;m afraid; there are only two or
three, down there, for so many,&rdquo; Paul Muniment remarked loudly, and with
a kind of incongruous cheerfulness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have thought a great deal about that. But there wouldn&rsquo;t be
room for more, you know,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora, this time in a very serious
tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much room for a family of that sort
anywhere&mdash;thirteen people of all ages and sizes,&rdquo; the young man
rejoined. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s pretty big, but there doesn&rsquo;t seem
room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are also thirteen at home;&rdquo; said Lady Aurora, laughing again.
&ldquo;We are also rather crowded.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mean at Inglefield?&rdquo; Rosy inquired eagerly,
in her dusky nook.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Inglefield. I am so much in town.&rdquo;
Hyacinth could see that Inglefield was a subject she wished to turn off, and to
do so she added, &ldquo;We too are of all ages and sizes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s fortunate you are not all <i>your</i> size!&rdquo; Paul
Muniment exclaimed, with a freedom at which Hyacinth was rather shocked, and
which led him to suspect that, though his new friend was a very fine fellow, a
delicate tact was not his main characteristic. Later he explained this by the
fact that he was rural and provincial, and had not had, like himself, the
benefit of metropolitan culture; and later still he asked himself what, after
all, such a character as that had to do with tact or with compliments, and why
its work in the world was not most properly performed by the simple exercise of
a rude, manly strength.
</p>

<p>
At this familiar allusion to her stature Lady Aurora turned hither and thither,
a little confusedly; Hyacinth saw her high, lean figure sway to and fro in the
dim little room. Her commotion carried her to the door, and with ejaculations
of which it was difficult to guess the meaning she was about to depart, when
Rosy detained her, having evidently much more social art than Paul.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s only because her ladyship is standing up
that she&rsquo;s so, you gawk? We are not thirteen, at any rate, and we have
got all the furniture we want, so that there&rsquo;s a chair for every one. Do
be seated again, Lady Aurora, and help me to entertain this gentleman. I
don&rsquo;t know your name, sir; perhaps my brother will mention it when he has
collected his wits. I am very glad to see you, though I don&rsquo;t see you
very well. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we light one of her ladyship&rsquo;s candles?
It&rsquo;s very different to that common thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth thought Miss Muniment very charming: he had begun to make her out
better by this time, and he watched her little wan, pointed face, framed, on
the pillow, by thick black hair. She was a diminutive dark person, pale and
wasted with a lifelong infirmity; Hyacinth thought her manner denoted high
cleverness&mdash;he judged it impossible to tell her age. Lady Aurora said she
ought to have gone, long since; but she seated herself, nevertheless, on the
chair that Paul pushed towards her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; this young man exclaimed. &ldquo;You told me
your name, but I&rsquo;ve clean forgotten it.&rdquo; Then, when Paul had
announced it again, he said to his sister, &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t tell you
much; there are bushels of Robinsons in the north. But you&rsquo;ll like him;
he&rsquo;s a very smart little fellow; I met him at the Poupins.&rdquo;
&lsquo;Puppin&rsquo; would represent the sound by which he designated the
French bookbinder, and that was the name by which Hyacinth always heard him
called at Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s. Hyacinth knew how much nearer to the right
thing he himself came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your name, like mine, represents a flower,&rdquo; said the little woman
in the bed. &ldquo;Mine is Rose Muniment, and her ladyship&rsquo;s is Aurora
Langrish. That means the morning, or the dawn; it&rsquo;s the most beautiful of
all, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; Rose Muniment addressed this inquiry to
Hyacinth, while Lady Aurora gazed at her shyly and mutely, as if she admired
her manner, her self-possession and flow of conversation. Her brother lighted
one of the visitor&rsquo;s candles, and the girl went on, without waiting for
Hyacinth&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it right that she should be
called the dawn, when she brings light where she goes? The Puppins are the
charming foreigners I have told you about,&rdquo; she explained to her friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so pleasant knowing a few foreigners!&rdquo; Lady Aurora
exclaimed, with a spasm of expression. &ldquo;They are often so very
fresh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Robinson&rsquo;s a sort of foreigner, and he&rsquo;s very
fresh,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment. &ldquo;He meets Mr Puppin quite on his own
ground. If I had his command of the lingo it would give me a lift.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should be very happy to help you with your French. I
feel the advantage of knowing it,&rdquo; Hyacinth remarked, finely, and became
conscious that his declaration drew the attention of Lady Aurora towards him;
so that he wondered what he could go on to say, to keep at that level. This was
the first time he had encountered, socially, a member of that aristocracy to
which he had now for a good while known it was Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s theory that
he belonged; and the occasion was interesting, in spite of the lady&rsquo;s
appearing to have so few of the qualities of her caste. She was about thirty
years of age; her nose was large and, in spite of the sudden retreat of her
chin, her face was long and lean. She had the manner of extreme
near-sightedness; her front teeth projected from her upper gums, which she
revealed when she smiled, and her fair hair, in tangled, silky skeins (Rose
Muniment thought it too lovely), drooped over her pink cheeks. Her clothes
looked as if she had worn them a good deal in the rain, and the note of a
certain disrepair in her apparel was given by a hole in one of her black
gloves, through which a white finger gleamed. She was plain and diffident, and
she might have been poor; but in the fine grain and sloping, shrinking slimness
of her whole person, the delicacy of her curious features, and a kind of
cultivated quality in her sweet, vague, civil expression, there was a
suggestion of race, of long transmission, of an organism highly evolved. She
was not a common woman; she was one of the caprices of an aristocracy. Hyacinth
did not define her in this manner to himself, but he received from her the
impression that, though she was a simple creature (which he learned later she
was not), aristocracies were complicated things. Lady Aurora remarked that
there were many delightful books in French, and Hyacinth rejoined that it was a
torment to know that (as he did, very well) when you didn&rsquo;t see your way
to getting hold of them. This led Lady Aurora to say, after a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, that she had a good lot of her own and that if he liked she should
be most happy to lend them to him. Hyacinth thanked her&mdash;thanked her even
too much, and felt both the kindness and the brilliant promise of the offer (he
knew the exasperation of having volumes in his hands, for external treatment,
which he couldn&rsquo;t take home at night, having tried that system,
surreptitiously, during his first weeks at Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s and come very
near losing his place in consequence), while he wondered how it could be put
into practice&mdash;whether she would expect him to call at her house and wait
in the hall till the books were sent out to him. Rose Muniment exclaimed that
that was her ladyship all over&mdash;always wanting to make up to people for
being less fortunate than herself: she would take the shoes off her feet for
any one that might take a fancy to them. At this the visitor declared that she
would stop coming to see her, if the girl caught her up, that way, for
everything; and Rosy, without heeding this remonstrance, explained to Hyacinth
that she thought it the least she could do to give what she had. She was so
ashamed of being rich that she wondered the lower classes didn&rsquo;t break
into Inglefield and take possession of all the treasures in the Italian room.
She was a tremendous socialist; she was worse than any one&mdash;she was worse,
even, than Paul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if she is worse than me,&rdquo; Hyacinth said, at a venture,
not understanding the allusions to Inglefield and the Italian room, which Miss
Muniment made as if she knew all about these places. After Hyacinth knew more
of the world he remembered this tone of Muniment&rsquo;s sister (he was to have
plenty of observation of it on other occasions) as that of a person who was in
the habit of visiting the nobility at their country-seats; she talked about
Inglefield as if she had stayed there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, I didn&rsquo;t know you were so advanced!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul
Muniment, who had been sitting silent, sidewise, in a chair that was too narrow
for him, with his big arm hugging the back. &ldquo;Have we been entertaining an
angel unawares?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth seemed to see that he was laughing at him, but he knew the way to face
that sort of thing was to exaggerate his meaning. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know
I was advanced? Why, I thought that was the principal thing about me. I think I
go about as far as it is possible to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought the principal thing about you was that you knew French,&rdquo;
Paul Muniment said, with an air of derision which showed Hyacinth that he
wouldn&rsquo;t put that ridicule upon him unless he liked him, at the same time
that it revealed to him that he himself had just been posturing a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know it for nothing. I&rsquo;ll say something very
neat and sharp to you, if you don&rsquo;t look out&mdash;just the sort of thing
they say so much in French.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, do say something of that kind; we should enjoy it so much!&rdquo;
cried Rosy, in perfect good faith, clasping her hands in expectation.
</p>

<p>
The appeal was embarrassing, but Hyacinth was saved from the consequences of it
by a remark from Lady Aurora, who quavered out the words after two or three
false starts, appearing to address him, now that she spoke to him directly,
with a sort of overdone consideration. &ldquo;I should like so very much to
know&mdash;it would be so interesting&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;how
far exactly you do go.&rdquo; She threw back her head very far, and thrust her
shoulders forward, and if her chin had been more adapted to such a purpose
would have appeared to point it at him.
</p>

<p>
This challenge was hardly less alarming than the other, for Hyacinth was far
from having ascertained the extent of his advance. He replied, however, with an
earnestness with which he tried to make up as far as possible for his
vagueness: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very strong indeed. I think I see my way to
conclusions, from which even Monsieur and Madame Poupin would shrink. Poupin,
at any rate; I&rsquo;m not so sure about his wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like so much to know Madame,&rdquo; Lady Aurora murmured, as if
politeness demanded that she should content herself with this answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Puppin isn&rsquo;t strong,&rdquo; said Muniment; &ldquo;you can
easily look over his head! He has a sweet assortment of phrases&mdash;they are
really pretty things to hear, some of them; but he hasn&rsquo;t had a new idea
these thirty years. It&rsquo;s the old stock that has been withering in the
window. All the same, he warms one up; he has got a spark of the sacred fire.
The principal conclusion that Mr Robinson sees his way to,&rdquo; he added to
Lady Aurora, &ldquo;is that your father ought to have his head chopped off and
carried on a pike.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, the French Revolution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t know anything about your father, my lady!&rdquo;
Hyacinth interposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear of the Earl of Inglefield?&rdquo; cried Rose
Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is one of the best,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora, as if she were pleading
for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely, but he is a landlord, and he has an hereditary seat and a
park of five thousand acres all to himself, while we are bundled together into
this sort of kennel.&rdquo; Hyacinth admired the young man&rsquo;s consistency
until he saw that he was chaffing; after which he still admired the way he
mixed up merriment with the tremendous opinions our hero was sure he
entertained. In his own imagination Hyacinth associated bitterness with the
revolutionary passion; but the young chemist, at the same time that he was
planning far ahead, seemed capable of turning revolutionists themselves into
ridicule, even for the entertainment of the revolutionised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I have told you often enough that I don&rsquo;t go with you at
all,&rdquo; said Rose Muniment, whose recumbency appeared not in the least to
interfere with her sense of responsibility. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a
tremendous mistake if you try to turn everything round. There ought to be
differences, and high and low, and there always will be, true as ever I lie
here. I think it&rsquo;s against everything, pulling down them that&rsquo;s
above.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything points to great changes in this country, but if once our
Rosy&rsquo;s against them, how can you be sure? That&rsquo;s the only thing
that makes me doubt,&rdquo; her brother went on, looking at her with a
placidity which showed the habit of indulgence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I may be ill, but I ain&rsquo;t buried, and if I&rsquo;m content
with my position&mdash;such a position as it is&mdash;surely other folk might
be with theirs. Her ladyship may think I&rsquo;m as good as her, if she takes
that notion; but she&rsquo;ll have a deal to do to make <i>me</i> believe
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you are much better than I, and I know very few people so good
as you,&rdquo; Lady Aurora remarked, blushing, not for her opinions, but for
her timidity. It was easy to see that, though she was original, she would have
liked to be even more original than she was. She was conscious, however, that
such a declaration might appear rather gross to persons who didn&rsquo;t see
exactly how she meant it; so she added, as quickly as her hesitating manner
permitted, to cover it up, &ldquo;You know there&rsquo;s one thing you ought to
remember, <i>à propos</i> of revolutions and changes and all that sort of
thing; I just mention it because we were talking of some of the dreadful things
that were done in France. If there were to be a great disturbance in this
country&mdash;and of course one hopes there won&rsquo;t&mdash;it would be my
impression that the people would behave in a different way altogether.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What people do you mean?&rdquo; Hyacinth allowed himself to inquire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the upper class, the people that have got all the things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t call them the people,&rdquo; observed Hyacinth,
reflecting the next instant that his remark was a little primitive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you call them the wretches, the villains!&rdquo; Rose Muniment
suggested, laughing merrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the things, but not all the brains,&rdquo; her brother said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, aren&rsquo;t they stupid?&rdquo; exclaimed her ladyship.
&ldquo;All the same, I don&rsquo;t think they would go abroad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go abroad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean like the French nobles, who emigrated so much. They would stay at
home and resist; they would make more of a fight. I think they would fight very
hard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it, and I&rsquo;m sure they would
win!&rdquo; cried Rosy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t collapse, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; Lady Aurora
continued. &ldquo;They would struggle till they were beaten.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you think they would be beaten in the end?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, yes,&rdquo; she replied, with a familiar brevity at which he
was greatly surprised. &ldquo;But of course one hopes it won&rsquo;t
happen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I infer from what you say that they talk it over a good deal among
themselves, to settle the line they will take,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment.
</p>

<p>
But Rosy intruded before Lady Aurora could answer. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
wicked to talk it over, and I&rsquo;m sure we haven&rsquo;t any business to
talk it over here! When her ladyship says that the aristocracy will make a fine
stand, I like to hear her say it, and I think she speaks in a manner that
becomes her own position. But there is something else in her tone which, if I
may be allowed to say so, I think a great mistake. If her ladyship expects, in
case of the lower classes coming up in that odious manner, to be let off
easily, for the sake of the concessions she may have made in advance, I would
just advise her to save herself the disappointment and the trouble. They
won&rsquo;t be a bit the wiser, and they won&rsquo;t either know or care. If
they are going to trample over their betters, it isn&rsquo;t on account of her
having seemed to give up everything to us here that they will let <i>her</i>
off. They will trample on her just the same as on the others, and they&rsquo;ll
say that she has got to pay for her title and her grand relations and her fine
appearance. Therefore I advise her not to waste her good nature in trying to
let herself down. When you&rsquo;re up so high as that you&rsquo;ve got to stay
there; and if Providence has made you a lady, the best thing you can do is to
hold up your head. I can promise your ladyship <i>I</i> would!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The close logic of this speech and the quaint self-possession with which the
little bedridden speaker delivered it struck Hyacinth as amazing, and confirmed
his idea that the brother and sister were a most extraordinary pair. It had a
terrible effect upon poor Lady Aurora, by whom so stern a lesson from so humble
a quarter had evidently not been expected, and who sought refuge from her
confusion in a series of bewildered laughs, while Paul Muniment, with his
humorous density, which was deliberate, and clever too, not seeing, or at any
rate not heeding, that she had been sufficiently snubbed by his sister,
inflicted a fresh humiliation by saying, &ldquo;Rosy&rsquo;s right, my lady.
It&rsquo;s no use trying to buy yourself off. You can&rsquo;t do enough; your
sacrifices don&rsquo;t count. You spoil your fun now, and you don&rsquo;t get
it made up to you later. To all you people nothing will ever be made up. Enjoy
your privileges while they last; it may not be for long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora listened to him with her eyes on his face; and as they rested there
Hyacinth scarcely knew what to make of her expression. Afterwards he thought he
could attach a meaning to it. She got up quickly when Muniment had ceased
speaking; the movement suggested that she had taken offence, and he would have
liked to show her that he thought she had been rather roughly used. But she
gave him no chance, not glancing at him for a moment. Then he saw that he was
mistaken and that, if she had flushed considerably, it was only with the
excitement of pleasure, the enjoyment of such original talk and of seeing her
friends at last as free and familiar as she wished them to be. &ldquo;You are
the most delightful people&mdash;I wish every one could know you!&rdquo; she
broke out. &ldquo;But I must really be going.&rdquo; She went to the bed, and
bent over Rosy and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Paul will see you as far as you like on your way home,&rdquo; this young
woman remarked.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora protested against this, but Paul, without protesting in return,
only took up his hat and looked at her, smiling, as if he knew his duty; upon
which her ladyship said, &ldquo;Well, you may see me downstairs; I forgot it
was so dark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must take her ladyship&rsquo;s own candle, and you must call a
cab,&rdquo; Rosy directed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t go in cabs. I walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you may go on the top of a &rsquo;bus, if you like; you
can&rsquo;t help being superb,&rdquo; Miss Muniment declared, watching her
sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Superb? Oh, mercy!&rdquo; cried the poor devoted, grotesque lady,
leaving the room with Paul, who asked Hyacinth to wait for him a little. She
neglected to bid good-night to our young man, and he asked himself what was to
be hoped from that sort of people, when even the best of them&mdash;those that
wished to be agreeable to the <i>demos</i>&mdash;reverted inevitably to the
supercilious. She had said no more about lending him her books.

<p>
&ldquo;She lives in Belgrave Square; she has ever so many brothers and sisters;
one of her sisters is married to Lord Warmington,&rdquo; Rose Muniment
instantly began, not apparently in the least discomposed at being left alone
with a strange young man in a room which was now half dark again, thanks to her
brother&rsquo;s having carried off the second and more brilliant candle. She
was so interested, for the time, in telling Hyacinth the history of Lady
Aurora, that she appeared not to remember how little she knew about himself.
Her ladyship had dedicated her life and her pocket-money to the poor and sick;
she cared nothing for parties, and races, and dances, and picnics, and life in
great houses, the usual amusements of the aristocracy; she was like one of the
saints of old come to life again out of a legend. She had made their
acquaintance, Paul&rsquo;s and hers, about a year before, through a friend of
theirs, such a fine, brave, young woman, who was in St Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital
for a surgical operation. She had been laid up there for weeks, during which
Lady Aurora, always looking out for those who couldn&rsquo;t help themselves,
used to come and talk to her and read to her, till the end of her time in the
ward, when the poor girl, parting with her kind friend, told her how she knew
of another unfortunate creature (for whom there was no place there, because she
was incurable) who would be mighty thankful for any little attention of that
sort. She had given Lady Aurora the address in Audley Court, and the very next
day her ladyship had knocked at their door. It wasn&rsquo;t because she was
poor&mdash;though in all conscience they were pinched enough&mdash;but because
she had so little satisfaction in her limbs. Lady Aurora came very often, for
several months, without meeting Paul, because he was always at his work; but
one day he came home early, on purpose to find her, to thank her for her
goodness, and also to see (Miss Muniment rather shyly intimated) whether she
were really so good as his extravagant little sister made her out. Rosy had a
triumph after that: Paul had to admit that her ladyship was beyond anything
that any one in his waking senses would believe. She seemed to want to give up
everything to those who were below her, and never to expect any thanks at all.
And she wasn&rsquo;t always preaching and showing you your duty; she wanted to
talk to you sociable-like, as if you were just her own sister. And <i>her</i>
own sisters were the highest in the land, and you might see her name in the
newspapers the day they were presented to the Queen. Lady Aurora had been
presented too, with feathers in her head and a long tail to her gown; but she
had turned her back upon it all with a kind of terror&mdash;a sort of
shivering, sinking feeling, which she had often described to Miss Muniment. The
day she had first seen Paul was the day they became so intimate (the three of
them together), if she might apply such a word as that to such a peculiar
connection. The little woman, the little girl, as she lay there (Hyacinth
scarcely knew how to characterise her), told our young man a very great secret,
in which he found himself too much interested to think of criticising so
headlong a burst of confidence. The secret was that, of all the people she had
ever seen in the world, her ladyship thought Rosy&rsquo;s Paul the very
cleverest. And she had seen the greatest, the most famous, the brightest of
every kind, for they all came to stay at Inglefield, thirty and forty of them
at once. She had talked with them all and heard them say their best (and you
could fancy how they would try to give it out at such a place as that, where
there was nearly a mile of conservatories and a hundred wax candles were
lighted at time), and at the end of it all she had made the remark to
herself&mdash;and she had made it to Rosy too&mdash;that there was none of them
had such a head on his shoulders as the young man in Audley Court. Rosy
wouldn&rsquo;t spread such a rumour as that in the court itself, but she wanted
every friend of her brother&rsquo;s (and she could see Hyacinth was that, by
the way he listened) to know what was thought of him by them that had an
experience of talent. She didn&rsquo;t wish to give it out that her ladyship
had lowered herself in any manner to a person that earned his bread in a dirty
shop (clever as he <i>might</i> be), but it was easy to see she minded what he
said as if he had been a bishop&mdash;or more, indeed, for she didn&rsquo;t
think much of bishops, any more than Paul himself, and that was an idea she had
got from him. Oh, she took it none so ill if he came back from his work before
she had gone; and to-night Hyacinth could see for himself how she had lingered.
This evening, she was sure, her ladyship would let him walk home with her half
the way. This announcement gave Hyacinth the prospect of a considerable session
with his communicative hostess; but he was very glad to wait, for he was
vaguely, strangely excited by her talk, fascinated by the little
queer-smelling, high-perched interior, encumbered with relics, treasured and
polished, of a poor north-country home, bedecked with penny ornaments and
related in so unexpected a manner to Belgrave Square and the great landed
estates. He spent half an hour with Paul Muniment&rsquo;s small, odd, crippled,
chattering, clever, trenchant sister, who gave him an impression of education
and native wit (she expressed herself far better than Pinnie, or than Millicent
Henning), and who startled, puzzled, and at the same time rather distressed,
him by the manner in which she referred herself to the most abject
class&mdash;the class that prostrated itself, that was in a fever and flutter
in the presence of its betters. That was Pinnie&rsquo;s attitude, of course;
but Hyacinth had long ago perceived that his adoptive mother had generations of
plebeian patience in her blood, and that though she had a tender soul she had
not a great one. He was more entertained than afflicted, however, by Miss
Muniment&rsquo;s tone, and he was thrilled by the frequency and familiarity of
her allusions to a kind of life he had often wondered about; this was the first
time he had heard it described with that degree of authority. By the nature of
his mind he was perpetually, almost morbidly, conscious that the circle in
which he lived was an infinitesimally small, shallow eddy in the roaring vortex
of London, and his imagination plunged again and again into the waves that
whirled past it and round it, in the hope of being carried to some brighter,
happier vision&mdash;the vision of societies in which, in splendid rooms, with
smiles and soft voices, distinguished men, with women who were both proud and
gentle, talked about art, literature and history. When Rosy had delivered
herself to her complete satisfaction on the subject of Lady Aurora, she became
more quiet, asking, as yet, however, no questions about Hyacinth, whom she
seemed to take very much for granted. He presently remarked that she must let
him come very soon again, and he added, to explain this wish, &ldquo;You know
you seem to me very curious people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Muniment did not in the least repudiate the imputation. &ldquo;Oh yes, I
dare say we seem very curious. I think we are generally thought so; especially
me, being so miserable and yet so lively.&rdquo; And she laughed till her bed
creaked again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s lucky you are ill; perhaps if you had your health you
would be all over the place,&rdquo; Hyacinth suggested. And he went on,
candidly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out, your being so up in
everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you need make it out! But you would, perhaps, if
you had known my father and mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were they such a rare lot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you would say so if you had ever been in the mines. Yes, in the
mines, where the filthy coal is dug out. That&rsquo;s where my father came
from&mdash;he was working in the pit when he was a child of ten. He never had a
day&rsquo;s schooling in his life; but he climbed up out of his black hole into
daylight and air, and he invented a machine, and he married my mother, who came
out of Durham, and (by her people) out of the pits and misery too. My father
had no great figure, but <i>she</i> was magnificent&mdash;the finest woman in
the country, and the bravest, and the best. She&rsquo;s in her grave now, and I
couldn&rsquo;t go to look at it even if it were in the nearest churchyard. My
father was as black as the coal he worked in: I know I&rsquo;m just his
pattern, barring that <i>he</i> did have his legs, when the liquor hadn&rsquo;t
got into them. But between him and my mother, for grand, high intelligence
there wasn&rsquo;t much to choose. But what&rsquo;s the use of brains if you
haven&rsquo;t got a backbone? My poor father had even less of that than I, for
with me it&rsquo;s only the body that can&rsquo;t stand up, and with him it was
the spirit. He discovered a kind of wheel, and he sold it, at Bradford, for
fifteen pounds: I mean the whole right of it, and every hope and pride of his
family. He was always straying, and my mother was always bringing him back. She
had plenty to do, with me a puny, ailing brat from the moment I opened my eyes.
Well, one night he strayed so far that he never came back; or only came back a
loose, bloody bundle of clothes. He had fallen into a gravel-pit; he
didn&rsquo;t know where he was going. That&rsquo;s the reason my brother will
never touch so much as you could wet your finger with, and that I only have a
drop once a week or so, in the way of a strengthener. I take what her ladyship
brings me, but I take no more. If she could have come to us before my mother
went, that would have been a saving! I was only nine when my father died, and
I&rsquo;m three years older than Paul. My mother did for us with all her might,
and she kept us decent&mdash;if such a useless little mess as me can be said to
be decent. At any rate, she kept me alive, and that&rsquo;s a proof she was
handy. She went to the wash-tub, and she might have been a queen, as she stood
there with her bare arms in the foul linen and her long hair braided on her
head. She was terrible handsome, but he would have been a bold man that would
have taken upon himself to tell her so. And it was from her we got our
education&mdash;she was determined we should rise above the common. You might
have thought, in her position, that she couldn&rsquo;t go into such things; but
she was a rare one for keeping you at your book. She could hold to her idea
when my poor father couldn&rsquo;t; and her idea, for us, was that Paul should
get learning and should look after me. You can see for yourself that
that&rsquo;s what has come about. How he got it is more than I can say, as we
never had a penny to pay for it; and of course my mother&rsquo;s cleverness
wouldn&rsquo;t have been of much use if he hadn&rsquo;t been clever himself.
Well, it was all in the family. Paul was a boy that would learn more from a
yellow placard pasted on a wall, or a time-table at a railway station, than
many a young fellow from a year at college. That was his only college, poor
lad&mdash;picking up what he could. Mother was taken when she was still needed,
nearly five years ago. There was an epidemic of typhoid, and of course it must
pass me over, the goose of a thing&mdash;only that I&rsquo;d have made a poor
feast&mdash;and just lay that gallant creature on her back. Well, she never
again made it ache over her soapsuds, straight and broad as it was. Not having
seen her, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said Rose Muniment, in conclusion;
&ldquo;but I just wanted you to understand that our parents had intellect, at
least, to give us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth listened to this recital with the deepest interest, and without being
in the least moved to allow for filial exaggeration; inasmuch as his impression
of the brother and sister was such as it would have taken a much more
marvellous tale to account for. The very way Rose Muniment sounded the word
&lsquo;intellect&rsquo; made him feel this; she pronounced it as if she were
distributing prizes for a high degree of it. No doubt the tipsy inventor and
the regal laundress had been fine specimens, but that didn&rsquo;t diminish the
merit of their highly original offspring. The girl&rsquo;s insistence upon her
mother&rsquo;s virtues (even now that her age had become more definite to him
he thought of her as a girl) touched in his heart a chord that was always ready
to throb&mdash;the chord of melancholy, bitter, aimless wonder as to the
difference it would have made in <i>his</i> spirit if there had been some pure,
honourable figure like that to shed her influence over it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you very fond of your brother?&rdquo; he inquired, after a little.
</p>

<p>
The eyes of his hostess glittered at him for a moment. &ldquo;If you ever
quarrel with him, you&rsquo;ll see whose side I&rsquo;ll take.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, before that I shall make you like <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very possible, and you&rsquo;ll see how I&rsquo;ll fling
you over!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, then, do you object so to his views&mdash;his ideas about the way
the people will come up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I think he&rsquo;ll get over them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo; cried Hyacinth. &ldquo;I have only known him
an hour or two, but I deny that, with all my strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the way you are going to make me like you&mdash;contradicting me
so?&rdquo; Miss Muniment inquired, with familiar archness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use, when you tell me I shall be sacrificed? One might
as well perish for a lamb as for a sheep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re a lamb at all. Certainly you are not,
if you want all the great people pulled down, and the most dreadful scenes
enacted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe in human equality? Don&rsquo;t you want anything
done for the groaning, toiling millions&mdash;those who have been cheated and
crushed and bamboozled from the beginning of time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth asked this question with considerable heat, but the effect of it was
to send his companion off into a new fit of laughter. &ldquo;You say that just
like a man that my brother described to me three days ago; a little man at some
club, whose hair stood up&mdash;Paul imitated the way he glowered and screamed.
I don&rsquo;t mean that you scream, you know; but you use almost the same words
that he did.&rdquo; Hyacinth scarcely knew what to make of this allusion, or of
the picture offered to him of Paul Muniment casting ridicule upon those who
spoke in the name of the down-trodden. But Rosy went on, before he had time to
do more than reflect that there would evidently be a great deal more to learn
about her brother: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least objection to seeing the
people improved, but I don&rsquo;t want to see the aristocracy lowered an inch.
I like so much to look at it up there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to know my aunt Pinnie&mdash;she&rsquo;s just such another
benighted idolater!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are making me like you very fast! And pray, who is your aunt
Pinnie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dressmaker, and a charming little woman. I should like her
to come and see you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not in her line&mdash;I never had on a dress
in my life. But, as a charming woman, I should be delighted to see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will bring her some day,&rdquo; said Hyacinth. And then he added,
rather incongruously, for he was irritated by the girl&rsquo;s optimism,
thinking it a shame that her sharpness should be enlisted on the wrong side,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want, for yourself, a better place to live in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She jerked herself up, and for a moment he thought she would jump out of her
bed at him. &ldquo;A better place than this? Pray, how could there be a better
place? Every one thinks it&rsquo;s lovely; you should see our view by
daylight&mdash;you should see everything I&rsquo;ve got. Perhaps you are used
to something very fine, but Lady Aurora says that in all Belgrave Square there
isn&rsquo;t such a cosy little room. If you think I&rsquo;m not perfectly
content, you are very much mistaken!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Such a sentiment as that could only exasperate Hyacinth, and his exasperation
made him indifferent to the fact that he had appeared to cast discredit on Miss
Muniment&rsquo;s apartment. Pinnie herself, submissive as she was, had spared
him that sort of displeasure; she groaned over the dinginess of Lomax Place
sufficiently to remind him that she had not been absolutely stultified by
misery. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you sometimes make your brother very angry?&rdquo;
he asked, smiling, of Rose Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Angry? I don&rsquo;t know what you take us for! I never saw him lose his
temper in his life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He must be a rum customer! Doesn&rsquo;t he really care for&mdash;for
what we were talking about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment Rosy was silent; then she replied, &ldquo;What my brother really
cares for&mdash;well, one of these days, when you know, you&rsquo;ll tell
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stared. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t he tremendously deep in&mdash;&rdquo;
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Deep in what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, in what&rsquo;s going on, beneath the surface. Doesn&rsquo;t he
belong to things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what he belongs to&mdash;you may ask
him!&rdquo; cried Rosy, laughing gaily again, as the opening door readmitted
the subject of their conversation. &ldquo;You must have crossed the water with
her ladyship,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I wonder who enjoyed their walk
most.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a handy old girl, and she has a goodish stride,&rdquo; said
the young man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s in love with you, simply, Mr Muniment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, my dear, for an admirer of the aristocracy you allow yourself a
license,&rdquo; Paul murmured, smiling at Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth got up, feeling that really he had paid a long visit; his curiosity
was far from satisfied, but there was a limit to the time one should spend in a
young lady&rsquo;s sleeping apartment. &ldquo;Perhaps she is; why not?&rdquo;
he remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps she is, then; she&rsquo;s daft enough for anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There have been fine folks before who have patted the people on the back
and pretended to enter into their life,&rdquo; Hyacinth said. &ldquo;Is she
only playing with that idea, or is she in earnest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In earnest&mdash;in terrible earnest, my dear fellow. I think she must
be rather crowded out at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Crowded out of Inglefield? Why, there&rsquo;s room for three
hundred!&rdquo; Rosy broke in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the kind of mob that&rsquo;s in possession, no
wonder she prefers Camberwell. We must be kind to the poor lady,&rdquo; Paul
added, in a tone which Hyacinth noticed. He attributed a remarkable meaning to
it; it seemed to say that people such as he were now so sure of their game that
they could afford to be magnanimous; or else it expressed a prevision of the
doom which hung over her ladyship&rsquo;s head. Muniment asked if Hyacinth and
Rosy had made friends, and the girl replied that Mr Robinson had made himself
very agreeable. &ldquo;Then you must tell me all about him after he goes, for
you know I don&rsquo;t know him much myself,&rdquo; said her brother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you everything; you know how I like
describing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was laughing to himself at the young lady&rsquo;s account of his
efforts to please her, the fact being that he had only listened to her own
eager discourse, without opening his mouth; but Paul, whether or no he guessed
the truth, said to him very pertinently, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very wonderful: she
can describe things she has never seen. And they are just like the
reality.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;ve never seen,&rdquo; Rosy rejoined.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the advantage of my lying here in such a manner. I see
everything in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to see your brother&rsquo;s meetings&mdash;his
secret societies and clubs. You put that aside when I asked you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t ask her that sort of thing,&rdquo; said Paul,
lowering at Hyacinth with a fierce frown&mdash;an expression which he perceived
in a moment to be humorously assumed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What am I to do, then, since you won&rsquo;t tell me anything definite
yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will be definite enough when you get hanged for it!&rdquo; Rosy
exclaimed, mockingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you want to poke your head into black holes?&rdquo; Muniment
asked, laying his hand on Hyacinth&rsquo;s shoulder, and shaking it gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you belong to the party of action?&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
solemnly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at the way he has picked up all the silly bits of
catchwords!&rdquo; Paul cried, laughing, to his sister. &ldquo;You must have
got that precious phrase out of the newspapers, out of some drivelling leader.
Is that the party you want to belong to?&rdquo; he went on, with his clear eyes
ranging over his diminutive friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll show me the thing itself I shall have no more occasion
to mind the newspapers,&rdquo; Hyacinth pleaded. It was his view of himself,
and it was not an unfair one, that his was a character that would never beg for
a favour; but now he felt that in any relation he might have with Paul Muniment
such a law would be suspended. This man he could entreat, pray to, go on his
knees to, without a sense of humiliation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What thing do you mean, infatuated, deluded youth?&rdquo; Paul went on,
refusing to be serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you know you do go to places you had far better keep out of, and
that often when I lie here and listen to steps on the stairs I&rsquo;m sure
they are coming in to make a search for your papers,&rdquo; Miss Muniment
lucidly interposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The day they find my papers, my dear, will be the day you&rsquo;ll get
up and dance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you ask me to come home with you for?&rdquo; Hyacinth demanded,
twirling his hat. It was an effort for him, for a moment, to keep the tears out
of his eyes; he found himself forced to put such a different construction on
his new friend&rsquo;s hospitality. He had had a happy impression that Muniment
perceived in him a possible associate, of a high type, in a subterranean
crusade against the existing order of things, and now it came over him that the
real use he had been put to was to beguile an hour for a pert invalid. That was
all very well, and he would sit by Miss Rosy&rsquo;s bedside, were it a part of
his service, every day in the week; only in such a case it should be his reward
to enjoy the confidence of her brother. This young man, at the present
juncture, justified the high estimate that Lady Aurora Langrish had formed of
his intelligence: whatever his natural reply to Hyacinth&rsquo;s question would
have been, he invented, at the moment, a better one, and said, at random,
smiling, and not knowing exactly what his visitor had meant&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did I ask you to come with me for? To see if you would be
afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What there was to be afraid of was to Hyacinth a quantity equally vague; but he
rejoined, quickly enough, &ldquo;I think you have only to try me to see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure if you introduce him to some of your low, wicked friends,
he&rsquo;ll be quite satisfied after he has looked round a bit,&rdquo; Miss
Muniment remarked, irrepressibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those are just the kind of people I want to know,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
ingenuously.
</p>

<p>
His ingenuousness appeared to touch Paul Muniment. &ldquo;Well, I see
you&rsquo;re a good &rsquo;un. Just meet me some night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where, where?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you where when we get away from <i>her</i>,&rdquo;
said his friend, laughing, but leading him out of the room again.

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap10"></a>X</h3>

<p>
Several months after Hyacinth had made the acquaintance of Paul Muniment,
Millicent Henning remarked to him that it was high time he should take her to
some place of amusement. He proposed the Canterbury Music Hall; whereupon she
tossed her head and affirmed that when a young lady had done for a young man
what she had done for him, the least he could do was to take her to some
theatre in the Strand. Hyacinth would have been a good deal at a loss to say
exactly what she had done for him, but it was familiar to him by this time that
she regarded him as under great obligations. From the day she came to look him
up in Lomax Place she had taken a position, largely, in his life, and he had
seen poor Pinnie&rsquo;s wan countenance grow several degrees more blank.
Amanda Pynsent&rsquo;s forebodings had been answered to the letter; that
bold-faced apparition had become a permanent influence. She never spoke to him
about Millicent but once, several weeks after her interview with the girl; and
this was not in a tone of rebuke, for she had divested herself for ever of any
maternal prerogative. Tearful, tremulous, deferential inquiry was now her only
weapon, and nothing could be more humble and circumspect than the manner in
which she made use of it. He was never at home of an evening, at present, and
he had mysterious ways of spending his Sundays, with which church-going had
nothing to do. The time had been when, often, after tea, he sat near the lamp
with the dressmaker, and, while her fingers flew, read out to her the works of
Dickens and of Scott; happy hours when he appeared to have forgotten the wrong
she had done him and she almost forgot it herself. But now he gulped down his
tea so fast that he hardly took off his hat while he sat there, and Pinnie,
with her quick eye for all matters of costume, noticed that he wore it still
more gracefully askew than usual, with a little victorious, exalted air. He
hummed to himself; he fingered his moustache; he looked out of the window when
there was nothing to look at; he seemed pre-occupied, absorbed in intellectual
excursions, half anxious and half delighted. During the whole winter Miss
Pynsent explained everything by three words murmured beneath her breath:
&ldquo;That forward jade!&rdquo; On the single occasion, however, on which she
sought relief from her agitation in an appeal to Hyacinth, she did not trust
herself to designate the girl by any epithet or title.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is only one thing I want to know,&rdquo; she said to him, in a
manner which might have seemed casual if in her silence, knowing her as well as
he did, he had not already perceived the implication of her thought.
&ldquo;Does she expect you to marry her, dearest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does who expect me? I should like to see the woman who does!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you know who I mean. The one that came after you&mdash;and
picked you right up&mdash;from the other end of London.&rdquo; And at the
remembrance of that insufferable scene poor Pinnie flamed up for a moment.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there plenty of young fellows down in that low part where
she lives, without her ravaging over here? Why can&rsquo;t she stick to her own
beat, I should like to know?&rdquo; Hyacinth had flushed at this inquiry, and
she saw something in his face which made her change her tone. &ldquo;Just
promise me this, my precious child: that if you get into any sort of mess with
that piece you&rsquo;ll immediately confide it to your poor old Pinnie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor old Pinnie sometimes makes me quite sick,&rdquo; Hyacinth
remarked, for answer. &ldquo;What sort of a mess do you suppose I&rsquo;ll get
into?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, suppose she does come it over you that you promised to marry
her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. She doesn&rsquo;t
want to marry any one to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what does she want to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you imagine I would tell a lady&rsquo;s secrets?&rdquo; the young man
inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, if she was a lady, I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; said
Pinnie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every woman&rsquo;s a lady when she has placed herself under one&rsquo;s
protection,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined, with his little manner of a man of the
world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Under your protection? Laws!&rdquo; cried Pinnie, staring. &ldquo;And
pray, who&rsquo;s to protect <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had said this she repented, because it seemed just the sort of
exclamation that would have made Hyacinth bite her head off. One of the things
she loved him for, however, was that he gave you touching surprises in this
line, had sudden inconsistencies of temper that were all for your advantage. He
was by no means always mild when he ought to have been, but he was sometimes so
when there was no obligation. At such moments Pinnie wanted to kiss him, and
she had often tried to make Mr Vetch understand what a fascinating trait of
character this was on the part of their young friend. It was rather difficult
to describe, and Mr Vetch never would admit that he understood, or that he had
observed anything that seemed to correspond to the dressmaker&rsquo;s somewhat
confused psychological sketch. It was a comfort to her in these days, and
almost the only one she had, that she was sure Anastasius Vetch understood a
good deal more than he felt bound to acknowledge. He was always up to his old
game of being a great deal cleverer than cleverness itself required; and it
consoled her present weak, pinched feeling to know that, although he still
talked of the boy as if it would be a pity to take him too seriously, that
wasn&rsquo;t the way he thought of him. He also took him seriously, and he had
even a certain sense of duty in regard to him. Miss Pynsent went so far as to
say to herself that the fiddler probably had savings, and that no one had ever
known of any one else belonging to him. She wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned it to
Hyacinth for the world, for fear of leading up to a disappointment; but she had
visions of a foolscap sheet, folded away in some queer little bachelor&rsquo;s
box (she couldn&rsquo;t fancy what men kept in such places), on which
Hyacinth&rsquo;s name would have been written down, in very big letters, before
a solicitor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m unprotected, in the nature of things,&rdquo; he replied,
smiling at his too scrupulous companion. Then he added, &ldquo;At any rate, it
isn&rsquo;t from that girl any danger will come to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you like her,&rdquo; Pinnie remarked, as if she
had spent on the subject treasures of impartiality.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jolly to hear one woman on the subject of another,&rdquo;
Hyacinth said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind and good, and yet you&rsquo;re
ready&mdash;&rdquo; He gave a philosophic sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what am I ready to do? I&rsquo;m not ready to see you gobbled up
before my eyes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid; she won&rsquo;t drag me to the
altar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray, doesn&rsquo;t she think you good enough&mdash;for one of the
beautiful Hennings?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, my poor Pinnie,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
wearily. &ldquo;I sometimes think there isn&rsquo;t a single thing in life that
you understand. One of these days she&rsquo;ll marry an alderman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An alderman&mdash;that creature?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An alderman, or a banker, or a bishop, or some one of that kind. She
doesn&rsquo;t want to end her career to-day; she wants to begin it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I wish she would take you later!&rdquo; the dressmaker exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth said nothing for a moment; then he broke out: &ldquo;What are you
afraid of? Look here, we had better clear this up, once for all. Are you afraid
of my marrying a girl out of a shop?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t, would you?&rdquo; cried Pinnie, with a kind of
conciliatory eagerness. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I like to hear you
talk!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think I would marry any one who would marry me?&rdquo; Hyacinth
went on. &ldquo;The kind of girl who would look at me is the kind of girl I
wouldn&rsquo;t look at.&rdquo; He struck Pinnie as having thought it all out;
which did not surprise her, as she had been familiar, from his youth, with his
way of following things up. But she was always delighted when he made a remark
which showed he was conscious of being of fine clay&mdash;flashed out an
allusion to his not being what he seemed. He was not what he seemed, but even
with Pinnie&rsquo;s valuable assistance he had not succeeded in representing to
himself, very definitely, what he was. She had placed at his disposal, for this
purpose, a passionate idealism which, employed in some case where it could have
consequences, might have been termed profligate, and which never cost her a
scruple or a compunction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure a princess might look at you and be none the
worse!&rdquo; she declared, in her delight at this assurance, more positive
than any she had yet received, that he was safe from the worst danger. This the
dressmaker considered to be the chance of his marrying some person like
herself. Still it came over her that his taste might be lowered, and before the
subject was dropped, on this occasion, she said to him that of course he must
be quite aware of all that was wanting to such a girl as Millicent
Henning&mdash;she pronounced her name at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t bother about what&rsquo;s wanting to her; I&rsquo;m
content with what she has.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Content, dearest&mdash;how do you mean?&rdquo; the little dressmaker
quavered. &ldquo;Content to make an intimate friend of her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is impossible I should discuss these matters with you,&rdquo;
Hyacinth replied, grandly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I see that. But I should think she would bore you
sometimes,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent murmured, cunningly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She does, I assure you, to extinction!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why do you spend every evening with her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where should you like me to spend my evenings? At some beastly
public-house&mdash;or at the Italian opera?&rdquo; His association with Miss
Henning was not so close as that, but nevertheless he wouldn&rsquo;t take the
trouble to prove to poor Pinnie that he enjoyed her society only two or three
times a week; that on other evenings he simply strolled about the streets (this
boyish habit clung to him), and that he had even occasionally the resource of
going to the Poupins&rsquo;, or of gossiping and smoking a pipe at some open
house-door, when the night was not cold, with a fellow-mechanic. Later in the
winter, after he had made Paul Muniment&rsquo;s acquaintance, the aspect of his
life changed considerably, though Millicent continued to be exceedingly mixed
up with it. He hated the taste of liquor and still more the taste of the places
where it was sold; besides which the types of misery and vice that one was
liable to see collected in them frightened and harrowed him, made him ask
himself questions that pierced the deeper because they were met by no answer.
It was both a blessing and a drawback to him that the delicate, charming
character of the work he did at Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s, under Eustache
Poupin&rsquo;s influence, was a kind of education of the taste, trained him in
the finest discriminations, in the perception of beauty and the hatred of
ugliness. This made the brutal, garish, stodgy decoration of public-houses,
with their deluge of gaslight, their glittering brass and pewter, their lumpish
woodwork and false colours, detestable to him; he was still very young when the
&lsquo;gin-palace&rsquo; ceased to convey to him an idea of the palatial.
</p>

<p>
For this unfortunate but remarkably organised youth, every displeasure or
gratification of the visual sense coloured his whole mind, and though he lived
in Pentonville and worked in Soho, though he was poor and obscure and cramped
and full of unattainable desires, it may be said of him that what was most
important in life for him was simply his impressions. They came from everything
he touched, they kept him thrilling and throbbing during a considerable part of
his waking consciousness, and they constituted, as yet, the principal events
and stages of his career. Fortunately, they were sometimes very delightful.
Everything in the field of observation suggested this or that; everything
struck him, penetrated, stirred; he had, in a word, more impressions than he
knew what to do with&mdash;felt sometimes as if they would consume or
asphyxiate him. He liked to talk about them, but it was only a few, here and
there, that he could discuss with Millicent Henning. He let Miss Pynsent
imagine that his hours of leisure were almost exclusively dedicated to this
young lady, because, as he said to himself, if he were to account to her for
every evening in the week it would make no difference&mdash;she would stick to
her suspicion; and he referred this perversity to the general weight of
misconception under which (at this crude period of his growth) he held it was
his lot to languish. It didn&rsquo;t matter to one whether one were a little
more or a little less misunderstood. He might have remembered that it mattered
to Pinnie, who, after her first relief at hearing him express himself so
properly on the subject of a matrimonial connection with Miss Henning, allowed
her faded, kind, weak face, little by little, to lengthen out to its old
solemnity. This came as the days went on, for it wasn&rsquo;t much comfort that
he didn&rsquo;t want to marry the young woman in Pimlico, when he allowed
himself to be held as tight as if he did. For the present, indeed, she simply
said, &ldquo;Oh, well, if you see her as she is, I don&rsquo;t care what you
do&rdquo;&mdash;a sentiment implying a certain moral recklessness on the part
of the good little dressmaker. She was irreproachable herself, but she had
lived for more than fifty years in a world of wickedness; like an immense
number of London women of her class and kind, she had acquired a certain
innocent cynicism, and she judged it quite a minor evil that Millicent should
be left lamenting, if only Hyacinth might get out of the scrape. Between a
forsaken maiden and a premature, lowering marriage for her beloved little boy,
she very well knew which she preferred. It should be added that her impression
of Millicent&rsquo;s power to take care of herself was such as to make it
absurd to pity her in advance. Pinnie thought Hyacinth the cleverest young man
in the world, but her state of mind implied somehow that the young lady in
Pimlico was cleverer. Her ability, at any rate, was of a kind that precluded
the idea of suffering, whereas Hyacinth&rsquo;s was rather associated with it.
</p>

<p>
By the time he had enjoyed for three months the acquaintance of the brother and
sister in Audley Court the whole complexion of his life seemed changed; it was
pervaded by an interest, an excitement, which overshadowed, though it by no
means supplanted, the brilliant figure of Miss Henning. It was pitched in a
higher key, altogether, and appeared to command a view of horizons equally
fresh and vast. Millicent, therefore, shared her dominion, without knowing
exactly what it was that drew her old play-fellow off, and without indeed
demanding of him an account which, on her own side, she was not prepared to
give. Hyacinth was, in the language of the circle in which she moved, her
fancy, and she was content to occupy, as regards himself, the same graceful and
somewhat irresponsible position. She had an idea that she was a most beneficent
friend: fond of him and careful of him as an elder sister might be; warning him
as no one else could do against the dangers of the town; putting that stiff
common sense, of which she was convinced that she possessed an extraordinary
supply, at the service of his incurable verdancy; and looking after him,
generally, as no one, poor child, had ever done. Millicent made light of the
little dressmaker, in this view of Hyacinth&rsquo;s past (she thought Pinnie no
better than a starved cat), and enjoyed herself immensely in the character of
guide and philosopher, while she pushed the young man with a robust elbow or
said to him, &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a sharp one, you are!&rdquo; Her
theory of herself, as we know, was that she was the sweetest girl in the world,
as well as the cleverest and handsomest, and there could be no better proof of
her kindness of heart than her disinterested affection for a snippet of a
bookbinder. Her sociability was certainly great, and so were her vanity, her
grossness, her presumption, her appetite for beer, for buns, for entertainment
of every kind. She represented, for Hyacinth, during this period, the eternal
feminine, and his taste, considering that he was fastidious, will be wondered
at; it will be judged that she did not represent it very favourably.
</p>

<p>
It may easily be believed that he scrutinised his infatuation even while he
gave himself up to it, and that he often wondered he should care for a girl in
whom he found so much to object to. She was vulgar, clumsy and grotesquely
ignorant; her conceit was proportionate, and she had not a grain of tact or of
quick perception. And yet there was something so fine about her, to his
imagination, and she carried with such an air the advantages she did possess,
that her figure constantly mingled itself even with those bright visions that
hovered before him after Paul Muniment had opened a mysterious window. She was
bold, and free, and generous, and if she was coarse she was neither false nor
cruel. She laughed with the laugh of the people, and if you hit her hard enough
she would cry with its tears. When Hyacinth was not letting his imagination
wander among the haunts of the aristocracy, and fancying himself stretched in
the shadow of an ancestral beech, reading the last number of the <i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, he was occupied with contemplations of a very different kind;
he was absorbed in the struggles and sufferings of the millions whose life
flowed in the same current as his, and who, though they constantly excited his
disgust, and made him shrink and turn away, had the power to chain his
sympathy, to make it glow to a kind of ecstasy, to convince him, for the time
at least, that real success in the world would be to do something with them and
for them. All this, strange to say, was never so vivid to him as when he was in
Millicent&rsquo;s company; which is a proof of his fantastic, erratic way of
seeing things. She had no such ideas about herself; they were almost the only
ideas she didn&rsquo;t have. She had no theories about redeeming or uplifting
the people; she simply loathed them, because they were so dirty, with the
outspoken violence of one who had known poverty, and the strange bedfellows it
makes, in a very different degree from Hyacinth, brought up, comparatively,
with Pinnie to put sugar in his tea, and keep him supplied with neckties, like
a little swell.
</p>

<p>
Millicent, to hear her talk, only wanted to keep her skirts clear and marry
some respectable tea-merchant. But for our hero she was magnificently plebeian,
in the sense that implied a kind of loud recklessness of danger and the
qualities that shine forth in a row. She summed up the sociable, humorous,
ignorant chatter of the masses, their capacity for offensive and defensive
passion, their instinctive perception of their strength on the day they should
really exercise it; and as much as any of this, their ideal of something smug
and prosperous, where washed hands, and plates in rows on dressers, and stuffed
birds under glass, and family photographs, would symbolise success. She was
none the less plucky for being at bottom a shameless Philistine, ambitious of a
front-garden with rockwork; and she presented the plebeian character in none
the less plastic a form. Having the history of the French Revolution at his
fingers&rsquo; ends, Hyacinth could easily see her (if there should ever be
barricades in the streets of London) with a red cap of liberty on her head and
her white throat bared so that she should be able to shout the louder the
Marseillaise of that hour, whatever it might be. If the festival of the Goddess
of Reason should ever be enacted in the British metropolis (and Hyacinth could
consider such possibilities without a smile, so much was it a part of the
little religion he had to remember, always, that there was no knowing what
might happen)&mdash;if this solemnity, I say, should be revived in Hyde Park,
who was better designated than Miss Henning to figure in a grand statuesque
manner, as the heroine of the occasion? It was plain that she had laid her
inconsequent admirer under a peculiar spell, since he could associate her with
such scenes as that while she consumed beer and buns at his expense. If she had
a weakness, it was for prawns; and she had, all winter, a plan for his taking
her down to Gravesend, where this luxury was cheap and abundant, when the fine
long days should arrive. She was never so frank and facetious as when she dwelt
on the details of a project of this kind; and then Hyacinth was reminded afresh
that it was an immense good fortune for her that she was handsome. If she had
been ugly he couldn&rsquo;t have listened to her; but her beauty glorified even
her accent, interfused her cockney genius with prismatic hues, gave her a large
and constant impunity.

<p>
She desired at last to raise their common experience to a loftier level, to
enjoy what she called a high-class treat. Their conversation was condemned, for
the most part, to go forward in the streets, the wintry, dusky, foggy streets,
which looked bigger and more numerous in their perpetual obscurity, and in
which everything was covered with damp, gritty smut, an odour extremely
agreeable to Miss Henning. Happily she shared Hyacinth&rsquo;s relish of vague
perambulation, and was still more addicted than he to looking into the windows
of shops, before which, in long, contemplative halts, she picked out freely the
articles she shouldn&rsquo;t mind calling her own. Hyacinth always pronounced
the objects of her selection hideous, and made no scruple to tell her that she
had the worst taste of any girl in the place. Nothing that he could say to her
affronted her so much, as her pretensions in the way of a cultivated judgment
were boundless. Had not, indeed, her natural aptitude been fortified, in the
neighbourhood of Buckingham Palace (there was scarcely anything they
didn&rsquo;t sell in the great shop of which she was an ornament), by daily
contact with the freshest products of modern industry? Hyacinth laughed this
establishment to scorn, and told her there was nothing in it, from top to
bottom, that a real artist would look at. She inquired, with answering
derision, if this were a description of his own few inches; but in reality she
was fascinated, as much as she was provoked, by his air of being difficult to
please, of seeing indescribable differences among things. She had given herself
out, originally, as very knowing, but he could make her feel stupid. When once
in a while he pointed out a commodity that he condescended to like (this
didn&rsquo;t happen often, because the only shops in which there was a chance
of his making such a discovery were closed at nightfall) she stared, bruised
him more or less with her elbow, and declared that if any one should give her
such a piece of rubbish she would sell it for fourpence. Once or twice she
asked him to be so good as to explain to her in what its superiority
consisted&mdash;she could not rid herself of a suspicion that there might be
something in his opinion, and she was angry at not finding herself as positive
as any one. But Hyacinth replied that it was no use attempting to tell her; she
wouldn&rsquo;t understand, and she had better continue to admire the insipid
productions of an age which had lost the sense of quality&mdash;a phrase which
she remembered, proposing to herself even to make use of it, on some future
occasion, but was quite unable to interpret.
</p>

<p>
When her companion demeaned himself in this manner it was not with a view of
strengthening the tie which united him to his childhood&rsquo;s friend; but the
effect followed, on Millicent&rsquo;s side, and the girl was proud to think
that she was in possession of a young man whose knowledge was of so high an
order that it was inexpressible. In spite of her vanity she was not so
convinced of her perfection as not to be full of ungratified aspirations; she
had an idea that it might be to her advantage some day to exhibit a sample of
that learning; and at the same time, when, in consideration, for instance, of a
jeweller&rsquo;s gas-lighted display in Great Portland Street, Hyacinth
lingered for five minutes in perfect silence, while she delivered herself
according to her wont at such junctures, she was a thousand miles from guessing
the feelings which made it impossible for him to speak. She could long for
things she was not likely to have; envy other people for possessing them, and
say it was a regular shame (she called it a <i>shime</i>); draw brilliant
pictures of what she should do with them if she did have them; and pass
immediately, with a mind unencumbered by superfluous inductions, to some other
topic, equally intimate and personal. The sense of privation, with her, was
often extremely acute; but she could always put her finger on the remedy. With
the imaginative, irresponsible little bookbinder the case was very different;
the remedy, with him, was terribly vague and impracticable. He was liable to
moods in which the sense of exclusion from all that he would have liked most to
enjoy in life settled upon him like a pall. They had a bitterness, but they
were not invidious&mdash;they were not moods of vengeance, of imaginary
spoliation: they were simply states of paralysing melancholy, of infinite sad
reflection, in which he felt that in this world of effort and suffering life
was endurable, the spirit able to expand, only in the best conditions, and that
a sordid struggle, in which one should go down to the grave without having
tasted them, was not worth the misery it would cost, the dull demoralisation it
would entail.
</p>

<p>
In such hours the great, roaring, indifferent world of London seemed to him a
huge organisation for mocking at his poverty, at his inanition; and then its
vulgarest ornaments, the windows of third-rate jewellers, the young man in a
white tie and a crush-hat who dandled by, on his way to a dinner-party, in a
hansom that nearly ran over one&mdash;these familiar phenomena became symbolic,
insolent, defiant, took upon themselves to make him smart with the sense that
<i>he</i> was out of it. He felt, moreover, that there was no consolation or
refutation in saying to himself that the immense majority of mankind were out
of it with him, and appeared to put up well enough with the annoyance. That was
their own affair; he knew nothing of their reasons or their resignation, and if
they chose neither to rebel nor to compare, he, at least, among the
disinherited, would keep up the standard. When these fits were upon the young
man, his brothers of the people fared, collectively, badly at his hands; their
function then was to represent in massive shape precisely the grovelling
interests which attracted one&rsquo;s contempt, and the only acknowledgment one
owed them was for the completeness of the illustration. Everything which, in a
great city, could touch the sentient faculty of a youth on whom nothing was
lost ministered to his conviction that there was no possible good fortune in
life of too &lsquo;quiet&rsquo; an order for him to appreciate&mdash;no
privilege, no opportunity, no luxury, to which he should not do justice. It was
not so much that he wished to enjoy as that he wished to know; his desire was
not to be pampered, but to be initiated. Sometimes, of a Saturday, in the long
evenings of June and July, he made his way into Hyde Park at the hour when the
throng of carriages, of riders, of brilliant pedestrians, was thickest; and
though lately, on two or three of these occasions, he had been accompanied by
Miss Henning, whose criticism of the scene was rich and distinct, a tremendous
little drama had taken place, privately, in his soul. He wanted to drive in
every carriage, to mount on every horse, to feel on his arm the hand of every
pretty woman in the place. In the midst of this his sense was vivid that he
belonged to the class whom the upper ten thousand, as they passed, didn&rsquo;t
so much as rest their eyes upon for a quarter of a second. They looked at
Millicent, who was safe to be looked at anywhere, and was one of the handsomest
girls in any company, but they only reminded him of the high human walls, the
deep gulfs of tradition, the steep embankments of privilege and dense layers of
stupidity, which fenced him off from social recognition.
</p>

<p>
And this was not the fruit of a morbid vanity on his part, or of a jealousy
that could not be intelligent; his personal discomfort was the result of an
exquisite admiration for what he had missed. There were individuals whom he
followed with his eyes, with his thoughts, sometimes even with his steps; they
seemed to tell him what it was to be the flower of a high civilisation. At
moments he was aghast when he reflected that the cause he had secretly
espoused, the cause from which M. Poupin and Paul Muniment (especially the
latter) had within the last few months drawn aside the curtain, proposed to
itself to bring about a state of things in which that particular scene would be
impossible. It made him even rather faint to think that he must choose; that he
couldn&rsquo;t (with any respect for his own consistency) work, underground,
for the enthronement of the democracy, and continue to enjoy, in however
platonic a manner, a spectacle which rested on a hideous social inequality. He
must either suffer with the people, as he had suffered before, or he must
apologise to others, as he sometimes came so near doing to himself, for the
rich; inasmuch as the day was certainly near when these two mighty forces would
come to a death-grapple. Hyacinth thought himself obliged, at present, to have
reasons for his feelings; his intimacy with Paul Muniment, which had now grown
very great, laid a good deal of that sort of responsibility upon him. Muniment
laughed at his reasons, whenever he produced them, but he appeared to expect
him, nevertheless, to have them ready, on demand, and Hyacinth had an immense
desire to do what he expected. There were times when he said to himself that it
might very well be his fate to be divided, to the point of torture, to be split
open by sympathies that pulled him in different ways; for hadn&rsquo;t he an
extraordinarily mingled current in his blood, and from the time he could
remember was there not one half of him that seemed to be always playing tricks
on the other, or getting snubs and pinches from it?
</p>

<p>
That dim, dreadful, confused legend of his mother&rsquo;s history, as regards
which what Pinnie had been able to tell him when he first began to question her
was at once too much and too little&mdash;this stupefying explanation had
supplied him, first and last, with a hundred different theories of his
identity. What he knew, what he guessed, sickened him, and what he didn&rsquo;t
know tormented him; but in his illuminated ignorance he had fashioned forth an
article of faith. This had gradually emerged from the depths of darkness in
which he found himself plunged as a consequence of the challenge he had
addressed to Pinnie&mdash;while he was still only a child&mdash;on the
memorable day which transformed the whole face of his future. It was one
January afternoon. He had come in from a walk; she was seated at her lamp, as
usual with her work, and she began to tell him of a letter that one of the
lodgers had got, describing the manner in which his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
shop, at Nottingham, had been rifled by burglars. He listened to her story,
standing in front of her, and then, by way of response, he said to her,
&ldquo;Who was that woman you took me to see ever so long ago?&rdquo; The
expression of her white face, as she looked up at him, her fear of such an
attack all dormant, after so many years&mdash;her strange, scared, sick glance
was a thing he could never forget, any more than the tone, with her breath
failing her, in which she had repeated, &ldquo;That woman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That woman, in the prison, years ago&mdash;how old was I?&mdash;who was
dying, and who kissed me so&mdash;as I have never been kissed, as I never shall
be again! Who <i>was</i> she, who <small>WAS</small> she?&rdquo; Poor Pinnie,
to do her justice, had made, after she recovered her breath, a gallant fight:
it lasted a week; it was to leave her spent and sore for evermore, and before
it was over Anastasius Vetch had been called in. At his instance she retracted
the falsehoods with which she had tried to put him off, and she made, at last,
a confession, a report, which he had reason to believe was as complete as her
knowledge. Hyacinth could never have told you why the crisis occurred on such a
day, why his question broke out at that particular moment. The strangeness of
the matter to himself was that the germ of his curiosity should have developed
so slowly; that the haunting wonder, which now, as he looked back, appeared to
fill his whole childhood, should only after so long an interval have crept up
to the air. It was only, of course, little by little that he had recovered his
bearings in his new and more poignant consciousness; little by little that he
reconstructed his antecedents, took the measure, so far as was possible, of his
heredity. His having the courage to disinter, in the <i>Times</i>, in the
reading-room of the British Museum, a report of his mother&rsquo;s trial for
the murder of Lord Frederick Purvis, which was very copious, the affair having
been quite a <i>cause célèbre;</i> his resolution in sitting under that
splendid dome, and, with his head bent to hide his hot eyes, going through
every syllable of the ghastly record, had been an achievement of comparatively
recent years. There were certain things that Pinnie knew which appalled him;
and there were others, as to which he would have given his hand to have some
light, that it made his heart ache supremely to find she was honestly ignorant
of. He scarcely knew what sort of favour Mr Vetch wished to make with him (as a
compensation for the precious part he had played in the business years before),
when the fiddler permitted himself to pass judgment on the family of the
wretched young nobleman for not having provided in some manner for the infant
child of his assassin. Why should they have provided, when it was evident that
they refused absolutely to recognise his lordship&rsquo;s responsibility?
Pinnie had to admit this, under Hyacinth&rsquo;s terrible cross-questioning;
she could not pretend, with any show of evidence, that Lord Whiteroy and the
other brothers (there had been no less than seven, most of them still living)
had, at the time of the trial, given any symptom of believing Florentine
Vivier&rsquo;s asseverations. That was their affair; he had long since made up
his mind that his own was very different. One couldn&rsquo;t believe at will,
and fortunately, in the case, he had no effort to make; for from the moment he
began to consider the established facts (few as they were, and poor and
hideous) he regarded himself, irresistibly, as the son of the recreant,
sacrificial Lord Frederick.
</p>

<p>
He had no need to reason about it; all his nerves and pulses pleaded and
testified. His mother had been a daughter of the wild French people (all that
Pinnie could tell him of her parentage was that Florentine had once mentioned
that in her extreme childhood her father had fallen, in the blood-stained
streets of Paris, on a barricade, with his gun in his hand); but on the other
side it took an English aristocrat&mdash;though a poor specimen, apparently,
had to suffice&mdash;to account for him. This, with its further implications,
became Hyacinth&rsquo;s article of faith; the reflection that he was a bastard
involved in a remarkable manner the reflection that he was a gentleman. He was
conscious that he didn&rsquo;t hate the image of his father, as he might have
been expected to do; and he supposed this was because Lord Frederick had paid
so tremendous a penalty. It was in the exaction of that penalty that the moral
proof, for Hyacinth, resided; his mother would not have armed herself on
account of any injury less cruel than the episode of which her miserable baby
was the living sign. She had avenged herself because she had been thrown over,
and the bitterness of that wrong had been in the fact that he, Hyacinth, lay
there in her lap. <i>He</i> was the one to have been killed: that remark our
young man often made to himself. That his attitude on this whole subject was of
a tolerably exalted, transcendent character, and took little account of any
refutation that might be based on a vulgar glance at three or four obtrusive
items, is proved by the importance that he attached, for instance, to the name
by which his mother had told poor Pinnie (when this excellent creature
consented to take him) that she wished him to be called. Hyacinth had been the
name of her father, a republican clockmaker, the martyr of his opinions, whose
memory she professed to worship; and when Lord Frederick insinuated himself
into her confidence he had reasons for preferring to be known as plain Mr
Robinson&mdash;reasons, however, which, in spite of the light thrown upon them
at the trial, it was difficult, after so many years, to enter into.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth never knew that Mr Vetch had said more than once to Pinnie, &ldquo;If
her contention as regards that dissolute young swell was true, why didn&rsquo;t
she make the child bear his real name, instead of his false
one?&rdquo;&mdash;an inquiry which the dressmaker answered with some ingenuity,
by remarking that she couldn&rsquo;t call him after a man she had murdered, and
that she supposed the unhappy girl didn&rsquo;t wish to publish to every one
the boy&rsquo;s connection with a crime that had been so much talked about. If
Hyacinth had assisted at this little discussion it is needless to say that he
would have sided with Miss Pynsent; though that his judgment was independently
formed is proved by the fact that Pinnie&rsquo;s fearfully indiscreet attempts
at condolence should not have made him throw up his version in disgust. It was
after the complete revelation that he understood the romantic innuendoes with
which his childhood had been surrounded, and of which he had never caught the
meaning; they having seemed but part and parcel of the habitual and promiscuous
divagations of his too constructive companion. When it came over him that, for
years, she had made a fool of him, to himself and to others, he could have
beaten her, for grief and shame; and yet, before he administered this rebuke he
had to remember that she only chattered (though she professed to have been
extraordinarily dumb) about a matter which he spent nine-tenths of his time in
brooding over. When she tried to console him for the horror of his
mother&rsquo;s history by descanting on the glory of the Purvises, and
reminding him that he was related, through them, to half the aristocracy of
England, he felt that she was turning the tragedy of his life into a monstrous
farce; and yet he none the less continued to cherish the belief that he was a
gentleman born. He allowed her to tell him nothing about the family in
question, and his stoicism on this subject was one of the reasons of the deep
dejection of her later years. If he had only let her idealise him a little to
himself she would have felt that she was making up, by so much, for her grand
mistake. He sometimes saw the name of his father&rsquo;s relations in the
newspaper, but he always turned away his eyes from it. He had nothing to ask of
them, and he wished to prove to himself that he could ignore them (who had been
willing to let him die like a rat) as completely as they ignored him.
Decidedly, he cried to himself at times, he was with the people, and every
possible vengeance of the people, as against such shameless egoism as that; but
all the same he was happy to feel that he had blood in his veins which would
account for the finest sensibilities.
</p>

<p>
He had no money to pay for places at a theatre in the Strand; Millicent Henning
having made it clear to him that on this occasion she expected something better
than the pit. &ldquo;Should you like the royal box, or a couple of stalls at
ten shillings apiece?&rdquo; he asked of her, with a frankness of irony which,
with this young lady, fortunately, it was perfectly possible to practise. She
had answered that she would content herself with a seat in the second balcony,
in the very front; and as such a position involved an expenditure which he was
still unable to meet, he waited one night upon Mr Vetch, to whom he had
already, more than once, had recourse in moments of pecuniary embarrassment.
His relations with the caustic fiddler were peculiar; they were much better in
fact than they were in theory. Mr Vetch had let him know&mdash;long before
this, and with the purpose of covering Pinnie to the utmost&mdash;the part he
had played when the question of the child&rsquo;s being taken to Mrs
Bowerbank&rsquo;s institution was so distressingly presented; and Hyacinth, in
the face of this information, had inquired, with some sublimity, what the devil
the fiddler had to do with his private affairs. Anastasius Vetch had replied
that it was not as an affair of his, but as an affair of Pinnie&rsquo;s, that
he had considered the matter; and Hyacinth afterwards had let the question
drop, though he had never been formally reconciled to his officious neighbour.
Of course his feeling about him had been immensely modified by the trouble Mr
Vetch had taken to get him a place with old Crookenden; and at the period of
which I write it had long been familiar to him that the fiddler didn&rsquo;t
care a straw what he thought of his advice at the famous crisis, and
entertained himself with watching the career of a youth put together of such
queer pieces. It was impossible to Hyacinth not to perceive that the old
man&rsquo;s interest was kindly; and to-day, at any rate, our hero would have
declared that nothing could have made up to him for not knowing the truth,
horrible as the truth might be. His miserable mother&rsquo;s embrace seemed to
furnish him with an inexhaustible fund of motive, and under the circumstances
that was a benefit. What he chiefly objected to in Mr Vetch was a certain air
of still regarding him as extremely juvenile; he would have got on with him
much better if the fiddler had consented to recognise the degree in which he
was already a man of the world. Vetch knew an immense deal about society, and
he seemed to know the more because he never swaggered&mdash;it was only little
by little you discovered it; but that was no reason for his looking as if his
chief entertainment resided in a private, diverting commentary on the
conversation of his young friend. Hyacinth felt that he himself gave
considerable evidence of liking his fellow-resident in Lomax Place when he
asked him to lend him half-a-crown. Somehow, circumstances, of old, had tied
them together, and though this partly vexed the little bookbinder it also
touched him; he had more than once solved the problem of deciding how to behave
(when the fiddler exasperated him) by simply asking him some service. The old
man had never refused. It was satisfactory to Hyacinth to remember this, as he
knocked at his door, very late, after he had allowed him time to come home from
the theatre. He knew his habits: Mr Vetch never went straight to bed, but sat
by his fire an hour, smoking his pipe, mixing a grog, and reading some old
book. Hyacinth knew when to go up by the light in his window, which he could
see from a court behind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know I haven&rsquo;t been to see you for a long time,&rdquo; he
said, in response to the remark with which the fiddler greeted him; &ldquo;and
I may as well tell you immediately what has brought me at present&mdash;in
addition to the desire to ask after your health. I want to take a young lady to
the theatre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch was habited in a tattered dressing-gown; his apartment smelt strongly
of the liquor he was consuming. Divested of his evening-gear he looked to our
hero so plucked and blighted that on the spot Hyacinth ceased to hesitate as to
his claims in the event of a social liquidation; he, too, was unmistakably a
creditor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you find your young lady rather
expensive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I find everything expensive,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, as if to finish that
subject.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Especially, I suppose, your secret societies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; the young man asked, staring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you told me, in the autumn, that you were just about to join a
few.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A few? How many do you suppose?&rdquo; And Hyacinth checked himself.
&ldquo;Do you suppose if I had been serious I would tell?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; Mr Vetch murmured, with a sigh. Then he went
on: &ldquo;You want to take her to my shop, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say she won&rsquo;t go there. She wants something in
the Strand: that&rsquo;s a great point. She wants very much to see the <i>Pearl
of Paraguay</i>. I don&rsquo;t wish to pay anything, if possible; I am sorry to
say I haven&rsquo;t a penny. But as you know people at the other theatres, and
I have heard you say that you do each other little favours, from place to
place&mdash;<i>à charge de revanche</i>, as the French say&mdash;it occurred to
me that you might be able to get me an order. The piece has been running a long
time, and most people (except poor devils like me) must have seen it: therefore
there probably isn&rsquo;t a rush.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch listened in silence, and presently he said, &ldquo;Do you want a
box?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no; something more modest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not a box?&rdquo; asked the fiddler, in a tone which Hyacinth knew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t got the clothes that people wear in that sort of
place, if you must have such a definite reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your young lady&mdash;has she got the clothes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say; she seems to have everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where does she get them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. She belongs to a big shop; she has to be
fine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a pipe?&rdquo; Mr Vetch asked, pushing an old
tobacco-pouch across the table to his visitor; and while the young man helped
himself he puffed a while in silence. &ldquo;What will she do with you?&rdquo;
he inquired at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will who do with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your big beauty&mdash;Miss Henning. I know all about her from
Pinnie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you know what she&rsquo;ll do with me!&rdquo; Hyacinth returned,
with rather a scornful laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but, after all, it doesn&rsquo;t very much matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, now the other matter&mdash;the International&mdash;are you very
deep in that?&rdquo; the fiddler went on, as if he had not heard him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did Pinnie tell you all about that?&rdquo; his visitor asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, our friend Eustace has told me a good deal. He knows you have put
your head into something. Besides, I see it,&rdquo; said Mr Vetch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you see it, pray?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have got such a speaking eye. Any one can tell, to look at you, that
you have become a nihilist, that you&rsquo;re a member of a secret society. You
seem to say to every one, &lsquo;Slow torture won&rsquo;t induce me to tell
where it meets!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get me an order, then?&rdquo; Hyacinth said, in a
moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear boy, I offer you a box. I take the greatest interest in
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They smoked together a while, and at last Hyacinth remarked, &ldquo;It has
nothing to do with the International.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it more terrible&mdash;more deadly secret?&rdquo; his companion
inquired, looking at him with extreme seriousness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you pretended to be a radical,&rdquo; answered Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, so I am&mdash;of the old-fashioned, constitutional,
milk-and-water, jog-trot sort. I&rsquo;m not an exterminator.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what we may be when the time comes,&rdquo; Hyacinth
rejoined, more sententiously than he intended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the time coming, then, my dear boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have a right to give you any more of a warning
than that,&rdquo; said our hero, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to do so much, I&rsquo;m sure, and to rush
in here at the small hours for the purpose. Meanwhile, in the few weeks, or
months, or years, or whatever they are, that are left, you wish to put in as
much enjoyment as you can squeeze, with the young ladies: that&rsquo;s a very
natural inclination.&rdquo; Then, irrelevantly, Mr Vetch inquired, &ldquo;Do
you see many foreigners?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see a good many.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what do you think of them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, all sorts of things. I rather like Englishmen better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Muniment, for example?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, what do you know about him?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him at Eustace&rsquo;s. I know that you and he are as
thick as thieves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He will distinguish himself some day, very much,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
who was perfectly willing, and indeed very proud, to be thought a close ally of
the chemist&rsquo;s assistant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely&mdash;very likely. And what will <i>he</i> do with
you?&rdquo; the fiddler inquired.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth got up; the two men looked at each other for an instant. &ldquo;Do get
me two good places in the second balcony,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch replied that he would do what he could, and three days afterwards he
gave the coveted order to his young friend. As he placed it in his hands he
said, &ldquo;You had better put in all the fun you can, you know!&rdquo;

<h3><a name="chap12"></a>XII</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth and his companion took their seats with extreme promptitude before the
curtain rose upon the <i>Pearl of Paraguay</i>. Thanks to Millicent&rsquo;s
eagerness not to be late they encountered the discomfort which had constituted
her main objection to going into the pit: they waited for twenty minutes at the
door of the theatre, in a tight, stolid crowd, before the official hour of
opening. Millicent, bareheaded and very tightly laced, presented a most
splendid appearance and, on Hyacinth&rsquo;s part, gratified a certain
youthful, ingenuous pride of possession in every respect save a tendency, while
ingress was denied them, to make her neighbours feel her elbows and to comment,
loudly and sarcastically, on the situation. It was more clear to him even than
it had been before that she was a young lady who in public places might easily
need a champion or an apologist. Hyacinth knew there was only one way to
apologise for a &lsquo;female&rsquo;, when the female was attached very closely
and heavily to one&rsquo;s arm, and was reminded afresh how little
constitutional aversion Miss Henning had to a row. He had an idea she might
think his own taste ran even too little in that direction, and had visions of
violent, confused scenes, in which he should in some way distinguish himself:
he scarcely knew in what way, and imagined himself more easily routing some
hulking adversary by an exquisite application of the retort courteous than by
flying at him with a pair of very small fists.
</p>

<p>
By the time they had reached their places in the balcony Millicent was rather
flushed and a good deal ruffled; but she had composed herself in season for the
rising of the curtain upon the farce which preceded the melodrama and which the
pair had had no intention of losing. At this stage a more genial agitation took
possession of her, and she surrendered her sympathies to the horse-play of the
traditional prelude. Hyacinth found it less amusing, but the theatre, in any
conditions, was full of sweet deception for him. His imagination projected
itself lovingly across the footlights, gilded and coloured the shabby canvas
and battered accessories, and lost itself so effectually in the fictive world
that the end of the piece, however long, or however short, brought with it a
kind of alarm, like a stoppage of his personal life. It was impossible to be
more friendly to the dramatic illusion. Millicent, as the audience thickened,
rejoiced more largely and loudly, held herself as a lady, surveyed the place as
if she knew all about it, leaned back and leaned forward, fanned herself with
majesty, gave her opinion upon the appearance and coiffure of every woman
within sight, abounded in question and conjecture, and produced, from her
pocket, a little paper of peppermint-drops, of which, under cruel threats, she
compelled Hyacinth to partake. She followed with attention, though not always
with success, the complicated adventures of the Pearl of Paraguay, through
scenes luxuriantly tropical, in which the male characters wore sombreros and
stilettos, and the ladies either danced the cachucha or fled from licentious
pursuit; but her eyes wandered, during considerable periods, to the occupants
of the boxes and stalls, concerning several of whom she had theories which she
imparted to Hyacinth while the play went on, greatly to his discomfiture, he
being unable to conceive of such levity. She had the pretension of knowing who
every one was; not individually and by name, but as regards their exact social
station, the quarter of London in which they lived, and the amount of money
they were prepared to spend in the neighbourhood of Buckingham Palace. She had
seen the whole town pass through her establishment there, and though Hyacinth,
from his infancy, had been watching it from his own point of view, his
companion made him feel that he had missed a thousand characteristic points, so
different were most of her interpretations from his, and so very bold and
irreverent. Miss Henning&rsquo;s observation of human society had not been of a
nature to impress her with its high moral tone, and she had a free off-hand
cynicism which imposed itself. She thought most ladies were hypocrites, and
had, in all ways, a low opinion of her own sex, which, more then once, before
this, she had justified to Hyacinth by narrating observations of the most
surprising kind, gathered during her career as a shop-girl. There was a
pleasing inconsequence, therefore, in her being moved to tears in the third act
of the play, when the Pearl of Paraguay, dishevelled and distracted, dragging
herself on her knees, implored the stern hidalgo her father, to believe in her
innocence in spite of the circumstances which seemed to condemn her&mdash;a
midnight meeting with the wicked hero in the grove of cocoanuts. It was at this
crisis, none the less, that she asked Hyacinth who his friends were in the
principal box on the left of the stage, and let him know that a gentleman
seated there had been watching him, at intervals, for the past half-hour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Watching <i>me!</i> I like that!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;When
I want to be watched I take you with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he has looked at me,&rdquo; Millicent answered, as if she had
no interest in denying that. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re the one he wants to get
hold of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To get hold of!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you ninny: don&rsquo;t hang back. He may make your fortune.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you would like him to come and sit by you I&rsquo;ll go and
take a walk in the Strand,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, entering into the humour of
the occasion but not seeing, from where he was placed, any gentleman in the
box. Millicent explained that the mysterious observer had just altered his
position; he had gone into the back of the box, which had considerable depth.
There were other persons in it, out of sight; she and Hyacinth were too much on
the same side. One of them was a lady, concealed by the curtain; her arm, bare
save for its bracelets, was visible at moments on the cushioned ledge. Hyacinth
saw it, in effect, reappear there, and even while the play went on contemplated
it with a certain interest; but until the curtain fell at the end of the act
there was no further symptom that a gentleman wished to get hold of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now do you say it&rsquo;s me he&rsquo;s after?&rdquo; Millicent asked
abruptly, giving him a sidelong dig, as the fiddlers in the orchestra began to
scrape their instruments for the interlude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course; I am only the pretext,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied, after he had
looked a moment, in a manner which he flattered himself was a proof of quick
self-possession. The gentleman designated by his companion was once more at the
front, leaning forward, with his arms on the edge. Hyacinth saw that he was
looking straight at him, and our young man returned his gaze&mdash;an effort
not rendered the more easy by the fact that, after an instant, he recognised
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if he knows us he might give some sign, and if he doesn&rsquo;t he
might leave us alone,&rdquo; Millicent declared, abandoning the distinction she
had made between herself and her companion. She had no sooner spoken than the
gentleman complied with the first mentioned of these conditions; he smiled at
Hyacinth across the house&mdash;he nodded to him with unmistakable
friendliness. Millicent, perceiving this, glanced at the young man from Lomax
Place and saw that the demonstration had brought a deep colour to his cheek. He
was blushing, flushing; whether with pleasure or embarrassment was not
immediately apparent to her. &ldquo;I say, I say&mdash;is it one of your grand
relations?&rdquo; she promptly exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, I can stare as well as
him;&rdquo; and she told Hyacinth it was a &lsquo;shime&rsquo; to bring a young
lady to the play when you hadn&rsquo;t so much as an opera-glass for her to
look at the company. &ldquo;Is he one of those lords your aunt was always
talking about in the Plice? Is he your uncle, or your grandfather, or your
first or second cousin? No, he&rsquo;s too young for your grandfather. What a
pity I can&rsquo;t see if he looks like you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At any other time Hyacinth would have thought these inquiries in the worst
possible taste, but now he was too much given up to other reflections. It
pleased him that the gentleman in the box should recognise and notice him,
because even so small a fact as this was an extension of his social existence;
but it also surprised and puzzled him, and it produced, generally, in his
easily-excited organism, an agitation of which, in spite of his attempted
self-control, the appearance he presented to Millicent was the sign. They had
met three times, he and his fellow-spectator; but they had met under
circumstances which, to Hyacinth&rsquo;s mind, would have made a furtive wink,
a mere tremor of the eyelid, a more judicious reference to the fact than so
public a salutation. Hyacinth would never have permitted himself to greet him
first; and this was not because the gentleman in the box
belonged&mdash;conspicuously as he did so&mdash;to a different walk of society.
He was apparently a man of forty, tall and lean and loose-jointed; he fell into
lounging, dawdling attitudes, and even at a distance he looked lazy. He had a
long, smooth, amused, contented face, unadorned with moustache or whisker, and
his brown hair parted itself evenly over his forehead, and came forward on
either temple in a rich, well-brushed lock which gave his countenance a certain
analogy to portraits of English gentlemen about the year 1820. Millicent
Henning had a glance of such range and keenness that she was able to make out
the details of his evening-dress, of which she appreciated the
&lsquo;form&rsquo;; to observe the character of his large hands; and to note
that he appeared to be perpetually smiling, that his eyes were extraordinarily
light in colour, and that in spite of the dark, well-marked brows arching over
them, his fine skin never had produced, and never would produce, a beard. Our
young lady pronounced him mentally a &lsquo;swell&rsquo; of the first
magnitude, and wondered more than ever where he had picked up Hyacinth. Her
companion seemed to echo her thought when he exclaimed, with a little surprised
sigh, almost an exhalation of awe, &ldquo;Well, I had no idea he was one of
that lot!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might at least tell me his name, so that I shall know what to call
him when he comes round to speak to us,&rdquo; the girl said, provoked at her
companion&rsquo;s incommunicativeness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Comes round to speak to us&mdash;a chap like that!&rdquo; Hyacinth
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure if he had been your own brother he couldn&rsquo;t
have grinned at you more! He may want to make my acquaintance after all; he
won&rsquo;t be the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gentleman had once more retreated from sight, and there was as much
evidence as that of the intention Millicent attributed to him. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m at all clear that I have a right to tell his
name,&rdquo; he remarked, with sincerity, but with a considerable disposition
at the same time to magnify an incident which deepened the brilliancy of the
entertainment he had been able to offer Miss Henning. &ldquo;I met him in a
place where he may not like to have it known that he goes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you go to places that people are ashamed of? Is it one of your
political clubs, as you call them, where that dirty young man from Camberwell,
Mr Monument (what do you call him?), fills your head with ideas that&rsquo;ll
bring you to no good? I&rsquo;m sure your friend over there doesn&rsquo;t look
as if he&rsquo;d be on <i>your</i> side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had indulged in this reflection himself; but the only answer he made
to Millicent was, &ldquo;Well, then, perhaps he&rsquo;ll be on yours!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laws, I hope <i>she</i> ain&rsquo;t one of the aristocracy!&rdquo;
Millicent exclaimed, with apparent irrelevance; and following the direction of
her eyes Hyacinth saw that the chair his mysterious acquaintance had quitted in
the stage-box was now occupied by a lady hitherto invisible&mdash;not the one
who had given them a glimpse of her shoulder and bare arm. This was an ancient
personage, muffled in a voluminous, crumpled white shawl&mdash;a stout, odd,
foreign-looking woman, whose head apparently was surmounted with a
light-coloured wig. She had a placid, patient air and a round, wrinkled face,
in which, however, a small, bright eye moved quickly enough. Her rather soiled
white gloves were too large for her, and round her head, horizontally arranged,
as if to keep her wig in its place, she wore a narrow band of tinsel,
decorated, in the middle of the forehead, by a jewel which the rest of her
appearance would lead the spectator to suppose false. &ldquo;Is the old woman
his mother? Where did she dig up her clothes? They look as if she had hired
them for the evening. Does <i>she</i> come to your wonderful club, too? I dare
say she cuts it fine, don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Millicent went on; and when
Hyacinth suggested, sportively, that the old lady might be, not the
gentleman&rsquo;s mother, but his wife or his &lsquo;fancy&rsquo;, she declared
that in that case, if he should come to see them, she wasn&rsquo;t afraid. No
wonder he wanted to get out of <i>that</i> box! The woman in the wig was
sitting there on purpose to look at them, but she couldn&rsquo;t say she was
particularly honoured by the notice of such an old guy. Hyacinth pretended that
he liked her appearance and thought her very handsome; he offered to bet
another paper of peppermints that if they could find out she would be some
tremendous old dowager, some one with a handle to her name. To this Millicent
replied, with an air of experience, that she had never thought the greatest
beauty was in the upper class; and her companion could see that she was
covertly looking over her shoulder to watch for his political friend and that
she would be disappointed if he did not come. This idea did not make Hyacinth
jealous, for his mind was occupied with another side of the business; and if he
offered sportive suggestions it was because he was really excited, dazzled, by
an incident of which the reader will have failed as yet to perceive the larger
relations. What moved him was not the pleasure of being patronised by a rich
man; it was simply the prospect of new experience&mdash;a sensation for which
he was always ready to exchange any present boon; and he was convinced that if
the gentleman with whom he had conversed in a small occult back-room in
Bloomsbury as Captain Godfrey Sholto&mdash;the Captain had given him his
card&mdash;had more positively than in Millicent&rsquo;s imagination come out
of the stage-box to see him, he would bring with him rare influences. This
nervous presentiment, lighting on our young man, was so keen that it
constituted almost a preparation; therefore, when at the end of a few minutes
he became aware that Millicent, with her head turned (her face was in his
direction), was taking the measure of some one who had come in behind them, he
felt that fate was doing for him, by way of a change, as much as could be
expected. He got up in his place, but not too soon to see that Captain Sholto
had been standing there a moment in contemplation of Millicent, and that this
young lady had performed with deliberation the ceremony of taking his measure.
The Captain had his hands in his pockets, and wore a crush-hat, pushed a good
deal backward. He laughed at the young couple in the balcony in the friendliest
way, as if he had known them both for years, and Millicent could see, on a
nearer view, that he was a fine, distinguished, easy, genial gentleman, at
least six feet high, in spite of a habit, or an affectation, of carrying
himself in a casual, relaxed, familiar manner. Hyacinth felt a little, after
the first moment, as if he were treating them rather too much as a pair of
children whom he had stolen upon, to startle; but this impression was speedily
removed by the air with which he said, laying his hand on our hero&rsquo;s
shoulder as he stood in the little passage at the end of the bench where the
holders of Mr Vetch&rsquo;s order occupied the first seats, &ldquo;My dear
fellow, I really thought I must come round and speak to you. My spirits are all
gone with this brute of a play. And those boxes are fearfully stuffy, you
know,&rdquo; he added, as if Hyacinth had had at least an equal experience of
that part of the theatre.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot here, too,&rdquo; Millicent&rsquo;s companion murmured.
He had suddenly become much more conscious of the high temperature, of his
proximity to the fierce chandelier, and he added that the plot of the play
certainly was unnatural, though he thought the piece rather well acted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the good old stodgy British tradition. This is the only
place where you find it still, and even here it can&rsquo;t last much longer;
it can&rsquo;t survive old Baskerville and Mrs Ruffler. &rsquo;Gad, how old
they are! I remember her, long past her prime, when I used to be taken to the
play, as a boy, in the Christmas holidays. Between them, they must be something
like a hundred and eighty, eh? I believe one is supposed to cry a good deal
about the middle,&rdquo; Captain Sholto continued, in the same friendly,
familiar, encouraging way, addressing himself to Millicent, upon whom, indeed,
his eyes had rested almost uninterruptedly from the first. She sustained his
glance with composure, but with just enough of an expression of reserve to
intimate (what was perfectly true) that she was not in the habit of conversing
with gentlemen with whom she was not acquainted. She turned away her face at
this (she had already given the visitor the benefit of a good deal of it) and
left him, as in the little passage he leaned against the parapet of the balcony
with his back to the stage, confronted with Hyacinth, who was now wondering,
with rather more vivid a sense of the relations of things, what he had come
for. He wanted to do him honour, in return for his civility, but he did not
know what one could talk about, at such short notice, to a person whom he
immediately perceived to be, in a most extensive, a really transcendent sense
of the term, a man of the world. He instantly saw Captain Sholto did not take
the play seriously, so that he felt himself warned off that topic, on which,
otherwise, he might have had much to say. On the other hand he could not, in
the presence of a third person, allude to the matters they had discussed at the
&lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;; nor could he suppose his visitor would expect this,
though indeed he impressed him as a man of humours and whims, who was amusing
himself with everything, including esoteric socialism and a little bookbinder
who had so much more of the gentleman about him than one would expect. Captain
Sholto may have been a little embarrassed, now that he was completely launched
in his attempt at fraternisation, especially after failing to elicit a smile
from Millicent&rsquo;s respectability; but he left to Hyacinth the burden of no
initiative, and went on to say that it was just this prospect of the dying-out
of the old British tradition that had brought him to-night. He was with a
friend, a lady who had lived much abroad, who had never seen anything of the
kind, and who liked everything that was characteristic. &ldquo;You know the
foreign school of acting is a very different affair,&rdquo; he said, again to
Millicent, who this time replied, &ldquo;Oh yes, of course,&rdquo; and
considering afresh the old lady in the box, reflected that she looked as if
there were nothing in the world that she, at least, hadn&rsquo;t seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have never been abroad,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, candidly, looking into
his friend&rsquo;s curious light-coloured eyes, the palest in tint he had ever
encountered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, there&rsquo;s a lot of nonsense talked about that!&rdquo;
Captain Sholto replied; while Hyacinth remained uncertain as to exactly what he
referred to, and Millicent decided to volunteer a remark.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are making a tremendous row on the stage. I should think it would
be very bad in those boxes.&rdquo; There was a banging and thumping behind the
curtain, the sound of heavy scenery pushed about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes; it&rsquo;s much better here, every way. I think you have the
best seats in the house,&rdquo; said Captain Sholto. &ldquo;I should like very
much to finish my evening beside you. The trouble is I have ladies&mdash;a pair
of them,&rdquo; he went on, as if he were seriously considering this
possibility. Then, laying his hand again on Hyacinth&rsquo;s shoulder, he
smiled at him a moment and indulged in a still greater burst of frankness:
&ldquo;My dear fellow, that is just what, as a partial reason, has brought me
up here to see you. One of my ladies has a great desire to make your
acquaintance!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To make my acquaintance?&rdquo; Hyacinth felt himself turning pale; the
first impulse he could have, in connection with such an announcement as
that&mdash;and it lay far down, in the depths of the unspeakable&mdash;was a
conjecture that it had something to do with his parentage on his father&rsquo;s
side. Captain Sholto&rsquo;s smooth, bright face, irradiating such unexpected
advances, seemed for an instant to swim before him. The Captain went on to say
that he had told the lady of the talks they had had, that she was immensely
interested in such matters&mdash;&ldquo;You know what I mean, she really
is&rdquo;&mdash;and that as a consequence of what he had said she had begged
him to come and ask his&mdash;a&mdash;his young friend (Hyacinth saw in a
moment that the Captain had forgotten his name) to descend into her box for a
little while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has a tremendous desire to talk with some one who looks at the whole
business from your standpoint, don&rsquo;t you see? And in her position she
scarcely ever has a chance, she doesn&rsquo;t come across them&mdash;to her
great annoyance. So when I spotted you to-night she immediately said that I
must introduce you at any cost. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, for a quarter of
an hour. I ought perhaps to tell you that she is a person who is used to having
nothing refused her. &lsquo;Go up and bring him down,&rsquo; you know, as if it
were the simplest thing in the world. She is really very much in earnest: I
don&rsquo;t mean about wishing to see you&mdash;that goes without
saying&mdash;but about the whole matter that you and I care for. Then I should
add&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t spoil anything&mdash;that she is the most charming
woman in the world, simply! Honestly, my dear boy, she is perhaps the most
remarkable woman in Europe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Captain Sholto delivered himself, with the highest naturalness and
plausibility, and Hyacinth, listening, felt that he himself ought perhaps to
resent the idea of being served up for the entertainment of imperious triflers,
but that somehow he didn&rsquo;t, and that it was more worthy of the part he
aspired to play in life to meet such occasions calmly and urbanely than to take
the trouble of dodging and going roundabout. Of course the lady in the box
couldn&rsquo;t be sincere; she might think she was, though even that was
questionable; but you couldn&rsquo;t really care for the cause that was
exemplified in the little back-room in Bloomsbury if you came to the theatre in
that style. It was Captain Sholto&rsquo;s style as well, but it had been by no
means clear to Hyacinth hitherto that <i>he</i> really cared. All the same,
this was no time for going into the question of the lady&rsquo;s sincerity, and
at the end of sixty seconds our young man had made up his mind that he could
afford to humour her. None the less, I must add, the whole proposal continued
to make things dance, to appear fictive, delusive; so that it sounded, in
comparison, like a note of reality when Millicent, who had been looking from
one of the men to the other, exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but who is to look after me?&rdquo; Her
assumption of the majestic had broken down, and this was the cry of nature.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could have been pleasanter and more indulgent of her alarm than the
manner in which Captain Sholto reassured her: &ldquo;My dear young lady, can
you suppose I have been unmindful of that? I have been hoping that after I have
taken down our friend and introduced him you would allow me to come back and,
in his absence, occupy his seat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was preoccupied with the idea of meeting the most remarkable woman in
Europe; but at this juncture he looked at Millicent Henning with some
curiosity. She rose to the situation, and replied, &ldquo;I am much obliged to
you, but I don&rsquo;t know who you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about that!&rdquo; the Captain exclaimed,
benevolently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I should introduce you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, and he mentioned
to Miss Henning the name of his distinguished acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the army?&rdquo; the young lady inquired, as if she must have every
guarantee of social position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;not in the navy! I have left the army, but it always sticks to
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Robinson, is it your intention to leave me?&rdquo; Millicent asked,
in a tone of the highest propriety.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth&rsquo;s imagination had taken such a flight that the idea of what he
owed to the beautiful girl who had placed herself under his care for the
evening had somehow effaced itself. Her words put it before him in a manner
that threw him quickly and consciously back upon his honour; yet there was
something in the way she uttered them that made him look at her harder still
before he replied, &ldquo;Oh dear, no, of course it would never do. I must
defer to some other occasion the honour of making the acquaintance of your
friend,&rdquo; he added, to Captain Sholto.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, we might manage it so easily now,&rdquo; this
gentleman murmured, with evident disappointment. &ldquo;It is not as if
Miss&mdash;a&mdash;Miss&mdash;a&mdash;were to be alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It flashed upon Hyacinth that the root of the project might be a desire of
Captain Sholto to insinuate himself into Millicent&rsquo;s graces; then he
asked himself why the most remarkable woman in Europe should lend herself to
that design, consenting even to receive a visit from a little bookbinder for
the sake of furthering it. Perhaps, after all, she was not the most remarkable;
still, even at a lower estimate, of what advantage could such a complication be
to her? To Hyacinth&rsquo;s surprise, Millicent&rsquo;s eye made acknowledgment
of his implied renunciation; and she said to Captain Sholto, as if she were
considering the matter very impartially, &ldquo;Might one know the name of the
lady who sent you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Princess Casamassima.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laws!&rdquo; cried Millicent Henning. And then, quickly, as if to cover
up the crudity of this ejaculation, &ldquo;And might one also know what it is,
as you say, that she wants to talk to him about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About the lower orders, the rising democracy, the spread of nihilism,
and all that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lower orders? Does she think we belong to them?&rdquo; the girl
demanded, with a strange, provoking laugh.
</p>

<p>
Captain Sholto was certainly the readiest of men. &ldquo;If she could see you,
she would think you one of the first ladies in the land.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never see me!&rdquo; Millicent replied, in a manner which
made it plain that she, at least, was not to be whistled for.
</p>

<p>
Being whistled for by a princess presented itself to Hyacinth as an indignity
endured gracefully enough by the heroes of several French novels in which he
had found a thrilling interest; nevertheless, he said, incorruptibly, to the
Captain, who hovered there like a Mephistopheles converted to disinterested
charity, &ldquo;Having been in the army, you will know that one can&rsquo;t
desert one&rsquo;s post.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Captain, for the third time, laid his hand on his young friend&rsquo;s
shoulder, and for a minute his smile rested, in silence, on Millicent Henning.
&ldquo;If I tell you simply I want to talk with this young lady, that certainly
won&rsquo;t help me, particularly, and there is no reason why it should.
Therefore I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole truth: I want to talk with her about
<i>you!</i>&rdquo; And he patted Hyacinth in a way which conveyed at once that
this idea must surely commend him to the young man&rsquo;s companion and that
he himself liked him infinitely.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was conscious of the endearment, but he remarked to Millicent that he
would do just as she liked; he was determined not to let a member of the
bloated upper class suppose that he held any daughter of the people cheap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care if you go,&rdquo; said Miss Henning. &ldquo;You
had better hurry&mdash;the curtain&rsquo;s going to rise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s charming of you! I&rsquo;ll rejoin you in three
minutes!&rdquo; Captain Sholto exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
He passed his hand into Hyacinth&rsquo;s arm, and as our hero lingered still, a
little uneasy and questioning Millicent always with his eyes, the girl went on,
with her bright boldness, &ldquo;That kind of princess&mdash;I should like to
hear all about her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you that, too,&rdquo; the Captain rejoined, with his
imperturbable pleasantness, as he led his young friend away. It must be
confessed that Hyacinth also rather wondered what kind of princess she was, and
his suspense on this point made his heart beat fast when, after traversing
steep staircases and winding corridors, they reached the small door of the
stage-box.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap13"></a>XIII</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth&rsquo;s first consciousness, after his companion had opened it, was of
his nearness to the stage, on which the curtain had now risen again. The play
was in progress, the actors&rsquo; voices came straight into the box, and it
was impossible to speak without disturbing them. This at least was his
inference from the noiseless way his conductor drew him in, and, without
announcing or introducing him, simply pointed to a chair and whispered,
&ldquo;Just drop into that; you&rsquo;ll see and hear beautifully.&rdquo; He
heard the door close behind him, and became aware that Captain Sholto had
already retreated. Millicent, at any rate, would not be left to languish in
solitude very long. Two ladies were seated in the front of the box, which was
so large that there was a considerable space between them; and as he stood
there, where Captain Sholto had planted him&mdash;they appeared not to have
noticed the opening of the door&mdash;they turned their heads and looked at
him. The one on whom his eyes first rested was the old lady whom he had already
contemplated at a distance; she looked queerer still on a closer view, and gave
him a little friendly, jolly nod. Her companion was partly overshadowed by the
curtain of the box, which she had drawn forward with the intention of shielding
herself from the observation of the house; she had still the air of youth, and
the simplest way to express the instant effect upon Hyacinth of her fair face
of welcome is to say that she was dazzling. He remained as Sholto had left him,
staring rather confusedly and not moving an inch; whereupon the younger lady
put out her hand&mdash;it was her left, the other rested on the ledge of the
box&mdash;with the expectation, as he perceived, to his extreme mortification,
too late, that he would give her his own. She converted the gesture into a sign
of invitation, and beckoned him, silently but graciously, to move his chair
forward. He did so, and seated himself between the two ladies; then, for ten
minutes, stared straight before him, at the stage, not turning his eyes
sufficiently even to glance up at Millicent in the balcony. He looked at the
play, but he was far from seeing it; he had no sense of anything but the woman
who sat there, close to him, on his right, with a fragrance in her garments and
a light about her which he seemed to see even while his head was averted. The
vision had been only of a moment, but it hung before him, threw a vague white
mist over the proceedings on the stage. He was embarrassed, overturned,
bewildered, and he knew it; he made a great effort to collect himself, to
consider the situation lucidly. He wondered whether he ought to speak, to look
at her again, to behave differently, in some way; whether she would take him
for a clown, for an idiot; whether she were really as beautiful as she had
seemed or if it were only a superficial glamour, which a renewed inspection
would dissipate. While he asked himself these questions the minutes went on,
and neither of his hostesses spoke; they watched the play in perfect stillness,
so that Hyacinth divined that this was the proper thing and that he himself
must remain dumb until a word should be bestowed upon him. Little by little he
recovered himself, took possession of his predicament, and at last transferred
his eyes to the Princess. She immediately perceived this, and returned his
glance, with a soft smile. She might well be a princess&mdash;it was impossible
to conform more to the finest evocations of that romantic word. She was fair,
brilliant, slender, with a kind of effortless majesty. Her beauty had an air of
perfection; it astonished and lifted one up, the sight of it seemed a
privilege, a reward. If the first impression it had given Hyacinth was to make
him feel strangely transported, he need not have been too much agitated, for
this was the effect the Princess Casamassima produced upon persons of a wider
experience and greater pretensions. Her dark eyes, blue or gray, something that
was not brown, were as sweet as they were splendid, and there was an
extraordinary light nobleness in the way she held her head. That head, where
two or three diamond stars glittered in the thick, delicate hair which defined
its shape, suggested to Hyacinth something antique and celebrated, which he had
admired of old&mdash;the memory was vague&mdash;in a statue, in a picture, in a
museum. Purity of line and form, of cheek and chin and lip and brow, a colour
that seemed to live and glow, a radiance of grace and eminence and
success&mdash;these things were seated in triumph in the face of the Princess,
and Hyacinth, as he held himself in his chair, trembling with the revelation,
wondered whether she were not altogether of some different substance from the
humanity he had hitherto known. She might be divine, but he could see that she
understood human needs&mdash;that she wished him to be at his ease and happy;
there was something familiar in her smile, as if she had seen him many times
before. Her dress was dark and rich; she had pearls round her neck, and an old
rococo fan in her hand. Hyacinth took in all these things, and finally said to
himself that if she wanted nothing more of him than that, he was content, he
would like it to go on; so pleasant was it to sit with fine ladies, in a dusky,
spacious receptacle which framed the bright picture of the stage and made
one&rsquo;s own situation seem a play within the play. The act was a long one,
and the repose in which his companions left him might have been a calculated
indulgence, to enable him to get used to them, to see how harmless they were.
He looked at Millicent, in the course of time, and saw that Captain Sholto,
seated beside her, had not the same standard of propriety, inasmuch as he made
a remark to her every few minutes. Like himself, the young lady in the balcony
was losing the play, thanks to her eyes being fixed on her friend from Lomax
Place, whose position she thus endeavoured to gauge. Hyacinth had quite given
up the Paraguayan complications; by the end of the half-hour his attention
might have come back to them, had he not then been engaged in wondering what
the Princess would say to him after the descent of the curtain&mdash;or whether
she would say anything. The consideration of this problem, as the moment of the
solution drew nearer, made his heart again beat faster. He watched the old lady
on his left, and supposed it was natural that a princess should have an
attendant&mdash;he took for granted she was an attendant&mdash;as different as
possible from herself. This ancient dame was without majesty or grace; huddled
together, with her hands folded on her stomach and her lips protruding, she
solemnly followed the performance. Several times, however, she turned her head
to Hyacinth, and then her expression changed; she repeated the jovial,
encouraging, almost motherly nod with which she had greeted him when he made
his bow, and by which she appeared to wish to intimate that, better than the
serene beauty on the other side, she could enter into the oddity, the
discomfort, of his situation. She seemed to say to him that he must keep his
head, and that if the worst should come to the worst she was there to look
after him. Even when, at last, the curtain descended, it was some moments
before the Princess spoke, though she rested her smile upon Hyacinth as if she
were considering what he would best like her to say. He might at that instant
have guessed what he discovered later&mdash;that among this lady&rsquo;s faults
(he was destined to learn that they were numerous) not the least eminent was an
exaggerated fear of the commonplace. He expected she would make some remark
about the play, but what she said was, very gently and kindly, &ldquo;I like to
know all sorts of people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you would find the least difficulty in
that,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if one wants anything very much, it&rsquo;s sure to be difficult.
Every one isn&rsquo;t as obliging as you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth could think, immediately, of no proper rejoinder to this; but the old
lady saved him the trouble by declaring, with a foreign accent, &ldquo;I think
you were most extraordinarily good-natured. I had no idea you would
come&mdash;to two strange women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we are strange women,&rdquo; said the Princess, musingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true that she finds things difficult; she makes every one
do everything,&rdquo; her companion went on.
</p>

<p>
The Princess glanced at her; then remarked to Hyacinth, &ldquo;Her name is
Madame Grandoni.&rdquo; Her tone was not familiar, but there was a friendly
softness in it, as if he had really taken so much trouble for them that it was
only just he should be entertained a little at their expense. It seemed to
imply, also, that Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s fitness for supplying such
entertainment was obvious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I am not Italian&mdash;ah no!&rdquo; the old lady cried. &ldquo;In
spite of my name, I am an honest, ugly, unfortunate German. But it
doesn&rsquo;t matter. She also, with such a name, isn&rsquo;t Italian, either.
It&rsquo;s an accident; the world is full of accidents. But she isn&rsquo;t
German, poor lady, any more.&rdquo; Madame Grandoni appeared to have entered
into the Princess&rsquo;s view, and Hyacinth thought her exceedingly amusing.
In a moment she added, &ldquo;That was a very charming person you were
with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she is very charming,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied, not sorry to have a
chance to say it.
</p>

<p>
The Princess made no remark on this subject, and Hyacinth perceived not only
that from her position in the box she could have had no glimpse of Millicent,
but that she would never take up such an allusion as that. It was as if she had
not heard it that she asked, &ldquo;Do you consider the play very
interesting?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment, and then told the simple truth. &ldquo;I must
confess that I have lost the whole of this last act.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, poor bothered young man!&rdquo; cried Madame Grandoni. &ldquo;You
see&mdash;you see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do I see?&rdquo; the Princess inquired. &ldquo;If you are annoyed
at being here now, you will like us later; probably, at least. We take a great
interest in the things you care for. We take a great interest in the
people,&rdquo; the Princess went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, allow me, allow me, and speak only for yourself!&rdquo; the elder
lady interposed. &ldquo;I take no interest in the people; I don&rsquo;t
understand them, and I know nothing about them. An honourable nature, of any
class, I always respect it; but I will not pretend to a passion for the
ignorant masses, because I have it not. Moreover, that doesn&rsquo;t touch the
gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess Casamassima had, evidently, a faculty of completely ignoring
things of which she wished to take no account; it was not in the least the air
of contempt, but a kind of thoughtful, tranquil absence, after which she came
back to the point where she wished to be. She made no protest against her
companion&rsquo;s speech, but said to Hyacinth, as if she were only vaguely
conscious that the old lady had been committing herself in some absurd way,
&ldquo;She lives with me; she is everything to me; she is the best woman in the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, fortunately, with many superficial defects, I am very good,&rdquo;
Madame Grandoni remarked.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth, by this time, was less embarrassed than when he presented himself to
the Princess Casamassima, but he was not less mystified; he wondered afresh
whether he were not being practised upon for some inconceivable end; so strange
did it seem to him that two such fine ladies should, of their own movement,
take the trouble to explain each other to a miserable little bookbinder. This
idea made him flush; it was as if it had come over him that he had fallen into
a trap. He was conscious that he looked frightened, and he was conscious the
moment afterwards that the Princess noticed it. This was, apparently, what made
her say, &ldquo;If you have lost so much of the play I ought to tell you what
has happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think he would follow that any more?&rdquo; Madame Grandoni
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you would tell me&mdash;if you would tell me&mdash;&rdquo; And then
Hyacinth stopped. He had been going to say, &lsquo;If you would tell me what
all this means and what you want of me, it would be more to the point!&rsquo;
but the words died on his lips, and he sat staring, for the woman at his right
was simply too beautiful. She was too beautiful to question, to judge by common
logic; and how could he know, moreover, what was natural to a person in that
exaltation of grace and splendour? Perhaps it was her habit to send out every
evening for some <i>naïf</i> stranger, to amuse her; perhaps that was the way
the foreign aristocracy lived. There was no sharpness in her face, at the
present moment at least; there was nothing but luminous sweetness, yet she
looked as if she knew what was going on in his mind. She made no eager attempt
to reassure him, but there was a world of delicate consideration in the tone in
which she said, &ldquo;Do you know, I am afraid I have already forgotten what
they have been doing in the play? It&rsquo;s terribly complicated; some one or
other was hurled over a precipice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re a brilliant pair,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni remarked, with
a laugh of long experience. &ldquo;I could describe everything. The person who
was hurled over the precipice was the virtuous hero, and you will see, in the
next act, that he was only slightly bruised.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t describe anything; I have so much to ask.&rdquo; Hyacinth
had looked away, in tacit deprecation, at hearing himself &lsquo;paired&rsquo;
with the Princess, and he felt that she was watching him. &ldquo;What do you
think of Captain Sholto?&rdquo; she went on, suddenly, to his surprise, if
anything, in his position, could excite that sentiment more than anything else;
and as he hesitated, not knowing what to say, she added, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he
a very curious type?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know him very little,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied; and he had no sooner
uttered the words than it struck him they were far from brilliant&mdash;they
were poor and flat, and very little calculated to satisfy the Princess. Indeed,
he reflected that he had said nothing at all that could place him in a
favourable light; so he continued, at a venture: &ldquo;I mean, I have never
seen him at home.&rdquo; That sounded still more silly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At home? Oh, he is never at home; he is all over the world. To-night he
was as likely to have been in Paraguay, for instance, as here. He is what they
call a cosmopolite. I don&rsquo;t know whether you know that species; very
modern, more and more frequent, and exceedingly tiresome. I prefer the Chinese!
He had told me he had had a great deal of interesting talk with you. That was
what made me say to him, &lsquo;Oh, do ask him to come in and see me. A little
interesting talk, that would be a change!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is very complimentary to me!&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear, you and I, you know, we never talk: we understand each
other without that!&rdquo; Then the Princess pursued, addressing herself to
Hyacinth, &ldquo;Do you never admit women?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Admit women?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Into those <i>séances</i>&mdash;what do you call them?&mdash;those
little meetings that Captain Sholto described to me. I should like so much to
be present. Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any ladies,&rdquo; Hyacinth said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s a rule, but I have seen nothing but
men;&rdquo; and he added, smiling, though he thought the dereliction rather
serious, and couldn&rsquo;t understand the part Captain Sholto was playing,
nor, considering the grand company he kept, how he had originally secured
admittance into the subversive little circle in Bloomsbury, &ldquo;You know
I&rsquo;m not sure Captain Sholto ought to go about reporting our
proceedings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see. Perhaps you think he&rsquo;s a spy, or something of that
sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, after a moment. &ldquo;I think a spy would be
more careful&mdash;would disguise himself more. Besides, after all, he has
heard very little.&rdquo; And Hyacinth smiled again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean he hasn&rsquo;t really been behind the scenes?&rdquo; the
Princess asked, bending forward a little, and now covering the young man
steadily with her deep, soft eyes, as if by this time he must have got used to
her and wouldn&rsquo;t flinch from such attention. &ldquo;Of course he
hasn&rsquo;t, and he never will be; he knows that, and that it&rsquo;s quite
out of his power to tell any real secrets. What he repeated to me was
interesting, but of course I could see that there was nothing the authorities,
anywhere, could put their hand on. It was mainly the talk he had had with you
which struck him so very much, and which struck me, as you see. Perhaps you
didn&rsquo;t know how he was drawing you out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid that&rsquo;s rather easy,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, with perfect
candour, as it came over him that he <i>had</i> chattered, with a vengeance, in
Bloomsbury, and had thought it natural enough then that his sociable
fellow-visitor should offer him cigars and attach importance to the views of a
clever and original young artisan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not sure that I find it so! However, I ought to tell you that you
needn&rsquo;t have the least fear of Captain Sholto. He&rsquo;s a perfectly
honest man, so far as he goes; and even if you had trusted him much more than
you appear to have done, he would be incapable of betraying you. However,
don&rsquo;t trust him: not because he&rsquo;s not safe, but because&mdash;No
matter, you will see for yourself. He has gone into that sort of thing simply
to please me. I should tell you, merely to make you understand, that he would
do anything for that. That&rsquo;s his own affair. I wanted to know something,
to learn something, to ascertain what really is going on; and for a woman
everything of that sort is so difficult, especially for a woman in my position,
who is known, and to whom every sort of bad faith is sure to be imputed. So
Sholto said he would look into the subject for me; poor man, he has had to look
into so many subjects! What I particularly wanted was that he should make
friends with some of the leading spirits, really characteristic types.&rdquo;
The Princess&rsquo;s voice was low and rather deep, and her tone very quick;
her manner of speaking was altogether new to her listener, for whom the
pronunciation of her words and the very punctuation of her sentences were a
kind of revelation of &lsquo;society&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely Captain Sholto doesn&rsquo;t suppose that <i>I</i> am a leading
spirit!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed, with the determination not to be laughed at
any more than he could help.
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated a moment; then she said, &ldquo;He told me you were very
original.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know, and&mdash;if you will allow me to say so&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think you know. How should you? I am one of many thousands of young
men of my class&mdash;you know, I suppose, what that is&mdash;in whose brains
certain ideas are fermenting. There is nothing original about me at all. I am
very young and very ignorant; it&rsquo;s only a few months since I began to
talk of the possibility of a social revolution with men who have considered the
whole ground much more than I have done. I&rsquo;m a mere particle in the
immensity of the people. All I pretend to is my good faith, and a great desire
that justice shall be done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess listened to him intently, and her attitude made him feel how
little <i>he</i>, in comparison, expressed himself like a person who had the
habit of conversation; he seemed to himself to stammer and emit common sounds.
For a moment she said nothing, only looking at him with her pure smile.
&ldquo;I do draw you out!&rdquo; she exclaimed, at last. &ldquo;You are much
more interesting to me than if you were an exception.&rdquo; At these last
words Hyacinth flinched a hair&rsquo;s breadth; the movement was shown by his
dropping his eyes. We know to what extent he really regarded himself as of the
stuff of the common herd. The Princess doubtless guessed it as well, for she
quickly added, &ldquo;At the same time, I can see that you are remarkable
enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think I am remarkable for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you have general ideas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every one has them to-day. They have them in Bloomsbury to a terrible
degree. I have a friend (who understands the matter much better than I) who has
no patience with them: he declares they are our danger and our bane. A few very
special ideas&mdash;if they are the right ones&mdash;are what we want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is your friend?&rdquo; the Princess asked, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Christina, Christina,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni murmured from the other
side of the box.
</p>

<p>
Christina took no notice of her, and Hyacinth, not understanding the warning,
and only remembering how personal women always are, replied, &ldquo;A young man
who lives in Camberwell, an assistant at a wholesale chemist&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If he had expected that this description of his friend was a bigger dose than
his hostess would be able to digest, he was greatly mistaken. She seemed to
look tenderly at the picture suggested by his words, and she immediately
inquired whether the young man were also clever, and whether she might not hope
to know him. Hadn&rsquo;t Captain Sholto seen him; and if so, why hadn&rsquo;t
he spoken of him, too? When Hyacinth had replied that Captain Sholto had
probably seen him, but that he believed he had had no particular conversation
with him, the Princess inquired, with startling frankness, whether her visitor
wouldn&rsquo;t bring his friend, some day, to see her.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth glanced at Madame Grandoni, but that worthy woman was engaged in a
survey of the house, through an old-fashioned eye-glass with a long gilt
handle. He had perceived, long before this, that the Princess Casamassima had
no desire for vain phrases, and he had the good taste to feel that, from
himself to such a personage, compliments, even if he had wished to pay them,
would have had no suitability. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he would be
willing to come. He&rsquo;s the sort of man that, in such a case, you
can&rsquo;t answer for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That makes me want to know him all the more. But you&rsquo;ll come
yourself, at all events, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Hyacinth murmured something about the unexpected honour; for, after all,
he had a French heredity, and it was not so easy for him to make unadorned
speeches. But Madame Grandoni, laying down her eye-glass, almost took the words
out of his mouth, with the cheerful exhortation, &ldquo;Go and see her&mdash;go
and see her once or twice. She will treat you like an angel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must think me very peculiar,&rdquo; the Princess remarked, sadly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I think. It will take a good while.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could make you trust me&mdash;inspire you with
confidence,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean only you, personally,
but others who think as you do. You would find I would go with you&mdash;pretty
far. I was answering just now for Captain Sholto; but who in the world is to
answer for me?&rdquo; And her sadness merged itself in a smile which appeared
to Hyacinth extraordinarily magnanimous and touching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I, my dear, I promise you!&rdquo; her ancient companion ejaculated,
with a laugh which made the people in the stalls look up at the box.
</p>

<p>
Her mirth was contagious; it gave Hyacinth the audacity to say to her, &ldquo;I
would trust <i>you</i>, if you did!&rdquo; though he felt, the next minute,
that this was even a more familiar speech than if he had said he wouldn&rsquo;t
trust her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It comes, then, to the same thing,&rdquo; the Princess went on.
&ldquo;She would not show herself with me in public if I were not respectable.
If you knew more about me you would understand what has led me to turn my
attention to the great social question. It is a long story, and the details
wouldn&rsquo;t interest you; but perhaps some day, if we have more talk, you
will put yourself a little in my place. I am very serious, you know; I am not
amusing myself with peeping and running away. I am convinced that we are living
in a fool&rsquo;s paradise, that the ground is heaving under our feet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the ground, my dear; it&rsquo;s you that are turning
somersaults,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni interposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you, my friend, you have the happy faculty of believing what you
like to believe. I have to believe what I see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She wishes to throw herself into the revolution, to guide it, to
enlighten it,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni said to Hyacinth, speaking now with
imperturbable gravity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure she could direct it in any sense she would wish!&rdquo; the
young man responded, in a glow. The pure, high dignity with which the Princess
had just spoken, and which appeared to cover a suppressed tremor of passion,
set Hyacinth&rsquo;s pulses throbbing, and though he scarcely saw what she
meant&mdash;her aspirations seeming so vague&mdash;her tone, her voice, her
wonderful face, showed that she had a generous soul.
</p>

<p>
She answered his eager declaration with a serious smile and a melancholy
head-shake. &ldquo;I have no such pretensions, and my good old friend is
laughing at me. Of course that is very easy; for what, in fact, can be more
absurd, on the face of it, than for a woman with a title, with diamonds, with a
carriage, with servants, with a position, as they call it, to sympathise with
the upward struggles of those who are below? &lsquo;Give all that up, and
we&rsquo;ll believe you,&rsquo; you have a right to say. I am ready to give
them up the moment it will help the cause; I assure you that&rsquo;s the least
difficulty. I don&rsquo;t want to teach, I want to learn; and, above all, I
want to know <i>à quoi m&rsquo;en tenir</i>. Are we on the eve of great
changes, or are we not? Is everything that is gathering force, underground, in
the dark, in the night, in little hidden rooms, out of sight of governments and
policemen and idiotic &lsquo;statesmen&rsquo;&mdash;heaven save them!&mdash;is
all this going to burst forth some fine morning and set the world on fire? Or
is it to sputter out and spend itself in vain conspiracies, be dissipated in
sterile heroisms and abortive isolated movements? I want to know <i>à quoi
m&rsquo;en tenir</i>,&rdquo; she repeated, fixing her visitor with more
brilliant eyes, as if he could tell her on the spot. Then, suddenly, she added
in a totally different tone, &ldquo;Excuse me, I have an idea you speak French.
Didn&rsquo;t Captain Sholto tell me so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have some little acquaintance with it,&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured.
&ldquo;I have French blood in my veins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She considered him as if he had proposed to her some kind of problem.
&ldquo;Yes, I can see that you are not <i>le premier venu</i>. Now, your
friend, of whom you were speaking, is a chemist; and you, yourself&mdash;what
is your occupation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a bookbinder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That must be delightful. I wonder if you would bind some books for
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would have to bring them to our shop, and I can do there only the
work that&rsquo;s given out to me. I might manage it by myself, at home,&rdquo;
Hyacinth added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like that better. And what do you call home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The place I live in, in the north of London: a little street you
certainly never heard of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it called?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lomax Place, at your service,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, laughing.
</p>

<p>
She laughed back at him, and he didn&rsquo;t know whether her brightness or her
gravity were the more charming. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I have heard of
it. I don&rsquo;t know London very well; I haven&rsquo;t lived here long. I
have spent most of my life abroad. My husband is a foreigner, an Italian. We
don&rsquo;t live together much. I haven&rsquo;t the manners of this
country&mdash;not of any class; have I, eh? Oh, this country&mdash;there is a
great deal to be said about it; and a great deal to be done, as you, of course,
understand better than any one. But I want to know London; it interests me more
than I can say&mdash;the huge, swarming, smoky, human city. I mean real London,
the people and all their sufferings and passions; not Park Lane and Bond
Street. Perhaps you can help me&mdash;it would be a great kindness:
that&rsquo;s what I want to know men like you for. You see it isn&rsquo;t idle,
my having given you so much trouble to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be very glad to show you all I know. But it isn&rsquo;t much,
and above all it isn&rsquo;t pretty,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whom do you live with, in Lomax Place?&rdquo; the Princess asked, by way
of rejoinder to this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Sholto is leaving the young lady&mdash;he is coming back
here,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni announced, inspecting the balcony with her
instrument. The orchestra had been for some time playing the overture to the
following act.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment. &ldquo;I live with a dressmaker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With a dressmaker? Do you mean&mdash;do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo; And the
Princess paused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean she&rsquo;s your wife?&rdquo; asked Madame Grandoni,
humorously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps she gives you rooms,&rdquo; remarked the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many do you think I have? She gives me everything, or she has done
so in the past. She brought me up; she is the best little woman in the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had better command a dress!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your family, where are they?&rdquo; the Princess continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None at all. I never had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the French blood that you speak of, and which I see perfectly in
your face&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t the English expression, or want of
expression&mdash;that must have come to you through some one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, through my mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And she is dead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Long ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great loss, because French mothers are usually so much to
their sons.&rdquo; The Princess looked at her painted fan a moment, as she
opened and closed it; after which she said, &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ll
come some day. We&rsquo;ll arrange it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth felt that the answer to this could be only a silent inclination of his
little person; and to make it he rose from his chair. As he stood there,
conscious that he had stayed long enough and yet not knowing exactly how to
withdraw, the Princess, with her fan closed, resting upright on her knee, and
her hands clasped on the end of it, turned up her strange, lovely eyes at him,
and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think anything will occur soon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will occur?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That there will be a crisis&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll make yourselves
felt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In this beautiful woman&rsquo;s face there was to Hyacinth&rsquo;s bewildered
perception something at once inspiring, tempting and mocking; and the effect of
her expression was to make him say, rather clumsily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and
ascertain;&rdquo; as if she had asked him whether her carriage were at the
door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what you are talking about; but please
don&rsquo;t have it for another hour or two. I want to see what becomes of the
Pearl!&rdquo; Madame Grandoni interposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember what I told you: I would give up
everything&mdash;everything!&rdquo; the Princess went on, looking up at the
young man in the same way. Then she held out her hand, and this time he knew
sufficiently what he was about to take it.
</p>

<p>
When he bade good-night to Madame Grandoni the old lady exclaimed to him, with
a comical sigh, &ldquo;Well, she <i>is</i> respectable!&rdquo; and out in the
lobby, when he had closed the door of the box behind him, he found himself
echoing these words and repeating mechanically, &ldquo;She <i>is</i>
respectable!&rdquo; They were on his lips as he stood, suddenly, face to face
with Captain Sholto, who laid his hand on his shoulder once more and shook him
a little, in that free yet insinuating manner for which this officer appeared
to be remarkable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, you were born under a lucky star.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never supposed it,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, changing colour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what in the world would you have? You have the faculty, the
precious faculty, of inspiring women with an interest&mdash;but an
interest!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, ask them in the box there! I behaved like a cretin,&rdquo; Hyacinth
declared, overwhelmed now with a sense of opportunities missed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t tell me that. And the lady upstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hyacinth gravely, &ldquo;what about her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Captain considered him a moment. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t talk to me of
anything but you. You may imagine how I liked it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, either. But I must go up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, she counts the minutes. Such a charming person!&rdquo; Captain
Sholto added, with more propriety of tone. As Hyacinth left him he called after
him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;you&rsquo;ll go far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the young man took his place in the balcony beside Millicent this damsel
gave him no greeting, nor asked any question about his adventures in the more
aristocratic part of the house. She only turned her fine complexion upon him
for some minutes, and as he himself was not in the mood to begin to chatter,
the silence continued&mdash;continued till after the curtain had risen on the
last act of the play. Millicent&rsquo;s attention was now, evidently, not at
her disposal for the stage, and in the midst of a violent scene, which included
pistol-shots and shrieks, she said at last to her companion, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
a tidy lot, your Princess, by what I learn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray, what do you know about her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what that fellow told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray, what was that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a bad &rsquo;un, as ever was. Her own husband has had
to turn her out of the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth remembered the allusion the lady herself had made to her matrimonial
situation; nevertheless, what he would have liked to reply to Miss Henning was
that he didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it. He withheld the doubt, and after a
moment remarked quietly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care? Well, I do, then!&rdquo; Millicent cried. And as
it was impossible, in view of the performance and the jealous attention of
their neighbours, to continue the conversation in this pitch, she contented
herself with ejaculating, in a somewhat lower key, at the end of five minutes,
during which she had been watching the stage, &ldquo;Gracious, what dreadful
common stuff!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap14"></a>XIV</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth did not mention to Pinnie or Mr Vetch that he had been taken up by a
great lady; but he mentioned it to Paul Muniment, to whom he now confided a
great many things. He had, at first, been in considerable fear of his straight,
loud, north-country friend, who showed signs of cultivating logic and criticism
to a degree that was hostile to free conversation; but he discovered later that
he was a man to whom one could say anything in the world, if one didn&rsquo;t
think it of more importance to be sympathised with than to be understood. For a
revolutionist, he was strangely good-natured. The sight of all the things he
wanted to change had seemingly no power to irritate him, and if he joked about
questions that lay very near his heart his pleasantry was not bitter nor
invidious; the fault that Hyacinth sometimes found with it, rather, was that it
was innocent to puerility. Our hero envied his power of combining a care for
the wide misery of mankind with the apparent state of mind of the cheerful and
virtuous young workman who, on Sunday morning, has put on a clean shirt, and,
not having taken the gilt off his wages the night before, weighs against each
other, for a happy day, the respective attractions of Epping Forest and
Gravesend. He was never sarcastic about his personal lot and his daily life; it
had not seemed to occur to him, for instance, that &lsquo;society&rsquo; was
really responsible for the condition of his sister&rsquo;s spinal column,
though Eustache Poupin and his wife (who practically, however, were as patient
as he) did everything they could to make him say so, believing, evidently, that
it would relieve him. Apparently he cared nothing for women, talked of them
rarely, and always decently, and had never a sign of a sweetheart, unless Lady
Aurora Langrish might pass for one. He never drank a drop of beer nor touched a
pipe; he always had a clear tone, a fresh cheek and a smiling eye, and once
excited on Hyacinth&rsquo;s part a kind of elder-brotherly indulgence by the
open-mouthed glee and credulity with which, when the pair were present, in the
sixpenny gallery, at Astley&rsquo;s, at an equestrian pantomime, he followed
the tawdry spectacle. He once told the young bookbinder that he was a
suggestive little beggar, and Hyacinth&rsquo;s opinion of him, by this time,
was so exalted that the remark had almost the value of a patent of nobility.
Our hero treated himself to an unlimited belief in him; he had always dreamed
of having some grand friendship, and this was the best opening he had ever
encountered. No one could entertain a sentiment of that sort better than
Hyacinth, or cultivate a greater luxury of confidence. It disappointed him,
sometimes, that it was not more richly repaid; that on certain important points
of the socialistic programme Muniment would never commit himself; and that he
had not yet shown the <i>fond du sac</i>, as Eustache Poupin called it, to so
ardent an admirer. He answered particular questions freely enough, and answered
them occasionally in a manner that made Hyacinth jump, as when, in reply to an
inquiry in regard to his view of capital punishment, he said that, so far from
wishing it abolished, he should go in for extending it much further&mdash;he
should impose it on those who habitually lied or got drunk; but his friend had
always a feeling that he kept back his best card and that even in the listening
circle in Bloomsbury, when only the right men were present, there were unspoken
conclusions in his mind which he didn&rsquo;t as yet think any one good enough
to be favoured with. So far, therefore, from suspecting him of
half-heartedness, Hyacinth was sure that he had extraordinary things in his
head; that he was thinking them out to the logical end, wherever it might land
him; and that the night he should produce them, with the door of the club-room
guarded and the company bound by a tremendous oath, the others would look at
each other and turn pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She wants to see you; she asked me to bring you; she was very
serious,&rdquo; Hyacinth said, relating his interview with the ladies in the
box at the play; which, however, now that he looked back upon it, seemed as
queer as a dream, and not much more likely than that sort of experience to have
a continuation in one&rsquo;s waking hours.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To bring me&mdash;to bring me where?&rdquo; asked Muniment. &ldquo;You
talk as if I were a sample out of your shop, or a little dog you had for sale.
Has she ever seen me? Does she think I&rsquo;m smaller than you? What does she
know about me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, principally, that you&rsquo;re a friend of mine&mdash;that&rsquo;s
enough for her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean that it ought to be enough for me that she&rsquo;s a friend
of yours? I have a notion you&rsquo;ll have some queer ones before you&rsquo;re
done; a good many more than I have time to talk to. And how can I go to see a
delicate female, with those paws?&rdquo; Muniment inquired, exhibiting ten
work-stained fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Buy a pair of gloves,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, who recognised the serious
character of this obstacle. But after a moment he added, &ldquo;No, you
oughtn&rsquo;t to do that; she wants to see dirty hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough; she needn&rsquo;t send for me for the purpose.
But isn&rsquo;t she making game of you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very possible, but I don&rsquo;t see what good it can do
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are not obliged to find excuses for the pampered classes. Their
bloated luxury begets evil, impudent desires; they are capable of doing harm
for the sake of harm. Besides, is she genuine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t, what becomes of your explanation?&rdquo; asked
Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter; at night all cats are gray. Whatever she
is, she&rsquo;s an idle, bedizened jade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you had seen her, you wouldn&rsquo;t talk of her that way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God forbid I should see her, then, if she&rsquo;s going to corrupt
me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you suppose she&rsquo;ll corrupt <i>me?</i>&rdquo; Hyacinth demanded,
with an expression of face and a tone of voice which produced, on his
friend&rsquo;s part, an explosion of mirth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can she, after all, when you are already such a little mass of
corruption?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, looking very grave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean that if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t say it? Haven&rsquo;t you
noticed that I say what I think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, not half of it: you&rsquo;re as close as a
fish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment looked at his companion a moment, as if he were rather struck
with the penetration of that remark; then he said, &ldquo;Well, then, if I
should give you the other half of my opinion of you, do you think you&rsquo;d
fancy it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save you the trouble. I&rsquo;m a very clever, conscientious,
promising young chap, and any one would be proud to claim me as a
friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that what your Princess told you? She must be a precious piece of
goods!&rdquo; Paul Muniment exclaimed. &ldquo;Did she pick your pocket
meanwhile?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes; a few minutes later I missed a silver cigar-case, engraved with
the arms of the Robinsons. Seriously,&rdquo; Hyacinth continued,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you consider it possible that a woman of that class should
want to know what is going on among the like of us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It depends upon what class you mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, a woman with a lot of jewels and the manners of an angel.
It&rsquo;s queer of course, but it&rsquo;s conceivable; why not? There may be
unselfish natures; there may be disinterested feelings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And there may be fine ladies in an awful funk about their jewels, and
even about their manners. Seriously, as you say, it&rsquo;s perfectly
conceivable. I am not in the least surprised at the aristocracy being curious
to know what we are up to, and wanting very much to look into it; in their
place I should be very uneasy, and if I were a woman with angelic manners very
likely I too should be glad to get hold of a soft, susceptible little
bookbinder, and pump him dry, bless his heart!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you afraid I&rsquo;ll tell her secrets?&rdquo; cried Hyacinth,
flushing with virtuous indignation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Secrets? What secrets could you tell her, my pretty lad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stared a moment. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me&mdash;you never
have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will, some day&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said Muniment,
who, evidently, had no intention of unkindness, a thing that appeared to be
impossible to him. &ldquo;And when we do, you&rsquo;ll cry with
disappointment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Hyacinth declared. And then he
asked whether his friend thought the Princess Casamassima a spy; and why, if
she were in that line, Mr Sholto was not&mdash;inasmuch as it must be supposed
he was not, since they had seen fit to let him walk in and out, at that rate,
in the place in Bloomsbury. Muniment did not even know whom he meant, not
having had any relations with the gentleman; but he summoned a sufficient image
when his companion had described the Captain&rsquo;s appearance. He then
remarked, with his usual geniality, that he didn&rsquo;t take him for a
spy&mdash;he took him for an ass; but even if he had edged himself into the
place with every intention to betray them, what handle could he possibly
get&mdash;what use, against them, could he make of anything he had seen or
heard? If he had a fancy to dip into working-men&rsquo;s clubs (Muniment
remembered, now, the first night he came; he had been brought by that German
cabinet-maker, who had a stiff neck and smoked a pipe with a bowl as big as a
stove); if it amused him to put on a bad hat, and inhale foul tobacco, and call
his &lsquo;inferiors&rsquo; &lsquo;my dear fellow&rsquo;; if he thought that in
doing so he was getting an insight into the people and going half-way to meet
them and preparing for what was coming&mdash;all this was his own affair, and
he was very welcome, though a man must be a flat who would spend his evening in
a hole like that when he might enjoy his comfort in one of those flaming big
shops, full of arm-chairs and flunkies, in Pall Mall. And what did he see,
after all, in Bloomsbury? Nothing but a &lsquo;social gathering&rsquo;, where
there were clay pipes, and a sanded floor, and not half enough gas, and the
principal newspapers; and where the men, as any one would know, were advanced
radicals, and mostly advanced idiots. He could pat as many of them on the back
as he liked, and say the House of Lords wouldn&rsquo;t last till midsummer; but
what discoveries would he make? He was simply on the same lay as
Hyacinth&rsquo;s Princess; he was nervous and scared, and he thought he would
see for himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he isn&rsquo;t the same sort as the Princess. I&rsquo;m sure
he&rsquo;s in a very different line!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Different, of course: she&rsquo;s a handsome woman, I suppose, and
he&rsquo;s an ugly man; but I don&rsquo;t think that either of them will save
us or spoil us. Their curiosity is natural, but I have got other things to do
than to show them over; therefore you can tell her serene highness that
I&rsquo;m much obliged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth reflected a moment, and then he said, &ldquo;You show Lady Aurora
over; you seem to wish to give her the information she desires; and
what&rsquo;s the difference? If it&rsquo;s right for her to take an interest,
why isn&rsquo;t it right for my Princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s already yours, what more can she want?&rdquo; Muniment
asked. &ldquo;All I know of Lady Aurora, and all I look at, is that she comes
and sits with Rosy, and brings her tea, and waits upon her. If the Princess
will do as much I&rsquo;ll tell her she&rsquo;s a woman of genius; but apart
from that I shall never take a grain of interest in her interest in the
masses&mdash;or in this particular mass!&rdquo; And Paul Muniment, with his
discoloured thumb, designated his own substantial person. His tone was
disappointing to Hyacinth, who was surprised at his not appearing to think the
episode at the theatre more remarkable and romantic. Muniment seemed to regard
his explanation of such a proceeding as all-sufficient; but when, a moment
later, he made use, in referring to the mysterious lady, of the expression that
she was &lsquo;quaking&rsquo;, Hyacinth broke out&mdash;&ldquo;Never in the
world; she&rsquo;s not afraid of anything!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my lad, not afraid of you, evidently!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth paid no attention to this coarse sally, but asked in a moment, with a
candour that was proof against further ridicule, &ldquo;Do you think she can do
me a hurt of any kind, if we follow up our acquaintance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very likely, but you must hit her back! That&rsquo;s your line, you
know: to go in for what&rsquo;s going, to live your life, to gratify the women.
I&rsquo;m an ugly, grimy brute; I&rsquo;ve got to watch the fires and mind the
shop; but you are one of those taking little beggars who ought to run about and
see the world; you ought to be an ornament to society, like a young man in an
illustrated story-book. Only,&rdquo; Muniment added in a moment, &ldquo;you
know, if she should hurt you very much, <i>then</i> I would go and see
her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had been intending for some time to take Pinnie to call on the
prostrate damsel in Audley Court, to whom he had promised that his benefactress
(he had told Rose Muniment that she was &lsquo;a kind of aunt&rsquo;) should
pay this civility; but the affair had been delayed by wan hesitations on the
part of the dressmaker, for the poor woman had hard work to imagine, to-day,
that there were people in London so forlorn that her countenance could be of
value to them. Her social curiosities had become very nearly extinct, and she
knew that she no longer made the same figure in public as when her command of
the fashions enabled her to illustrate them in her own little person, by the
aid of a good deal of whalebone. Moreover she felt that Hyacinth had strange
friends and still stranger opinions; she suspected that he took an unnatural
interest in politics and was somehow not on the right side, little as she knew
about parties or causes; and she had a vague conviction that this kind of
perversity only multiplied the troubles of the poor, who, according to theories
which Pinnie had never reasoned out, but which, in her bosom, were as deep as
religion, ought always to be of the same way of thinking as the rich. They were
unlike them enough in their poverty, without trying to add other differences.
When at last she accompanied Hyacinth to Camberwell, one Saturday evening at
midsummer, it was in a sighing, sceptical, second-best manner; but if he had
told her he wished it she would have gone with him to a <i>soirée</i> at a
scavenger&rsquo;s. There was no more danger of Rose Muniment&rsquo;s being out
than of one of the bronze couchant lions in Trafalgar Square having walked down
Whitehall; but he had let her know in advance, and he perceived, as he opened
her door in obedience to a quick, shrill summons, that she had had the happy
thought of inviting Lady Aurora to help her to entertain Miss Pynsent. Such, at
least, was the inference he drew from seeing her ladyship&rsquo;s memorable
figure rise before him for the first time since his own visit. He presented his
companion to their reclining hostess, and Rosy immediately repeated her name to
the representative of Belgrave Square. Pinnie curtsied down to the ground, as
Lady Aurora put out her hand to her, and slipped noiselessly into a chair
beside the bed. Lady Aurora laughed and fidgeted, in a friendly, cheerful, yet
at the same time rather pointless manner, and Hyacinth gathered that she had no
recollection of having met him before. His attention, however, was mainly given
to Pinnie: he watched her jealously, to see whether, on this important
occasion, she would not put forth a certain stiff, quaint, polished politeness,
of which she possessed the secret and which made her resemble a pair of
old-fashioned sugar-tongs. Not only for Pinnie&rsquo;s sake, but for his own as
well, he wished her to pass for a superior little woman, and he hoped she
wouldn&rsquo;t lose her head if Rosy should begin to talk about Inglefield. She
was, evidently, much impressed by Rosy, and kept repeating, &ldquo;Dear,
dear!&rdquo; under her breath, as the small, strange person in the bed rapidly
explained to her that there was nothing in the world she would have liked so
much as to follow <i>her</i> delightful profession, but that she couldn&rsquo;t
sit up to it, and had never had a needle in her hand but once, when at the end
of three minutes it had dropped into the sheets and got into the mattress, so
that she had always been afraid it would work out again and stick into her; but
it hadn&rsquo;t done so yet, and perhaps it never would&mdash;she lay so quiet,
she didn&rsquo;t push it about much. &ldquo;Perhaps you would think it&rsquo;s
me that trimmed the little handkerchief I wear round my neck,&rdquo; Miss
Muniment said; &ldquo;perhaps you would think I couldn&rsquo;t do less, lying
here all day long, with complete command of my time. Not a stitch of it.
I&rsquo;m the finest lady in London; I never lift my finger for myself.
It&rsquo;s a present from her ladyship&mdash;it&rsquo;s her ladyship&rsquo;s
own beautiful needlework. What do you think of that? Have you ever met any one
so favoured before? And the work&mdash;just look at the work, and tell me what
you think of that!&rdquo; The girl pulled off the bit of muslin from her neck
and thrust it at Pinnie, who looked at it confusedly and exclaimed,
&ldquo;Dear, dear, dear!&rdquo; partly in sympathy, partly as if, in spite of
the consideration she owed every one, those were very strange proceedings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very badly done; surely you see that,&rdquo; said Lady
Aurora. &ldquo;It was only a joke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, everything&rsquo;s a joke!&rdquo; cried the irrepressible
invalid&mdash;&ldquo;everything except my state of health; that&rsquo;s
admitted to be serious. When her ladyship sends me five shillings&rsquo; worth
of coals it&rsquo;s only a joke; and when she brings me a bottle of the finest
port, that&rsquo;s another; and when she climbs up seventy-seven stairs (there
are seventy-seven, I know perfectly, though I never go up or down), at the
height of the London season, to spend the evening with me, that&rsquo;s the
best of all. I know all about the London season, though I never go out, and I
appreciate what her ladyship gives up. She is very jocular indeed, but,
fortunately, I know how to take it. You can see that it wouldn&rsquo;t do for
me to be touchy, can&rsquo;t you, Miss Pynsent?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear, dear, I should be so glad to make you anything myself; it would be
better&mdash;it would be better&mdash;&rdquo; Pinnie murmured, hesitating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be better than my poor work. I don&rsquo;t know how to do that
sort of thing, in the least,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t mean that, my lady&mdash;I only meant it
would be more convenient. Anything in the world she might fancy,&rdquo; the
dressmaker went on, as if it were a question of the invalid&rsquo;s appetite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you see I don&rsquo;t wear things&mdash;only a flannel jacket, to be
a bit tidy,&rdquo; Miss Muniment rejoined. &ldquo;I go in only for smart
counterpanes, as you can see for yourself;&rdquo; and she spread her white
hands complacently over her coverlet of brilliant patchwork. &ldquo;Now
doesn&rsquo;t that look to you, Miss Pynsent, as if it might be one of her
ladyship&rsquo;s jokes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my good friend, how can you? I never went so far as that!&rdquo;
Lady Aurora interposed, with visible anxiety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve given me almost everything; I sometimes forget. This
only cost me sixpence; so it comes to the same thing as if it had been a
present. Yes, only sixpence, in a raffle in a bazaar at Hackney, for the
benefit of the Wesleyan Chapel, three years ago. A young man who works with my
brother, and lives in that part, offered him a couple of tickets; and he took
one, and I took one. When I say &lsquo;I&rsquo;, of course I mean that he took
the two; for how should I find (by which I mean, of course, how should
<i>he</i> find) a sixpence in that little cup on the chimney-piece unless he
had put it there first? Of course my ticket took a prize, and of course, as my
bed is my dwelling-place, the prize was a beautiful counterpane, of every
colour of the rainbow. Oh, there never was such luck as mine!&rdquo; Rosy
exclaimed, flashing her gay, strange eyes at Hyacinth, as if on purpose to
irritate him with her contradictious optimism.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very lovely; but if you would like another, for a change,
I&rsquo;ve got a great many pieces,&rdquo; Pinnie remarked, with a generosity
which made the young man feel that she was acquitting herself finely.
</p>

<p>
Rose Muniment laid her little hand on the dressmaker&rsquo;s arm, and
responded, quickly, &ldquo;No, not a change, not a change. How can there be a
change when there&rsquo;s already everything? There&rsquo;s everything
here&mdash;every colour that was ever seen, or composed, or dreamed of, since
the world began.&rdquo; And with her other hand she stroked, affectionately,
her variegated quilt. &ldquo;You have a great many pieces, but you
haven&rsquo;t as many as there are here; and the more you should patch them
together the more the whole thing would resemble this dear, dazzling old
friend. I have another idea, very, very charming, and perhaps her ladyship can
guess what it is.&rdquo; Rosy kept her fingers on Pinnie&rsquo;s arm, and,
smiling, turned her brilliant eyes from one of her female companions to the
other, as if she wished to associate them as much as possible in their interest
in her. &ldquo;In connection with what we were talking about a few minutes
ago&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t your ladyship just go a little further, in the same
line?&rdquo; Then, as Lady Aurora looked troubled and embarrassed, blushing at
being called upon to answer a conundrum, as it were, so publicly, her infirm
friend came to her assistance. &ldquo;It will surprise you at first, but it
won&rsquo;t when I have explained it: my idea is just simply a pink
dressing-gown!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A pink dressing-gown!&rdquo; Lady Aurora repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With a neat black trimming! Don&rsquo;t you see the connection with what
we were talking of before our good visitors came in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would be very pretty,&rdquo; said Pinnie. &ldquo;I have made them
like that, in my time. Or blue, trimmed with white.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, pink and black, pink and black&mdash;to suit my complexion. Perhaps
you didn&rsquo;t know I have a complexion; but there are very few things I
haven&rsquo;t got! Anything at all I should fancy, you were so good as to say.
Well now, I fancy that! Your ladyship does see the connection by this time,
doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora looked distressed, as if she felt that she certainly ought to see
it but was not sure that even yet it didn&rsquo;t escape her, and as if, at the
same time, she were struck with the fact that this sudden evocation might
result in a strain on the little dressmaker&rsquo;s resources. &ldquo;A pink
dressing-gown would certainly be very becoming, and Miss Pynsent would be very
kind,&rdquo; she said; while Hyacinth made the mental comment that it was a
largeish order, as Pinnie would have, obviously, to furnish the materials as
well as the labour. The amiable coolness with which the invalid laid her under
contribution was, however, to his sense, quite in character, and he reflected
that, after all, when you were stretched on your back like that you had the
right to reach out your hands (it wasn&rsquo;t far you could reach at best) and
seize what you could get. Pinnie declared that she knew just the article Miss
Muniment wanted, and that she would undertake to make a sweet thing of it; and
Rosy went on to say that she must explain of what use such an article would be,
but for this purpose there must be another guess. She would give it to Miss
Pynsent and Hyacinth&mdash;as many times as they liked: What <i>had</i> she and
Lady Aurora been talking about before they came in? She clasped her hands, and
her eyes glittered with her eagerness, while she continued to turn them from
Lady Aurora to the dressmaker. What would they imagine? What would they think
natural, delightful, magnificent&mdash;if one could only end, at last, by
making out the right place to put it? Hyacinth suggested, successively, a cage
of Java sparrows, a music-box and a shower-bath&mdash;or perhaps even a
full-length portrait of her ladyship; and Pinnie looked at him askance, in a
frightened way, as if perchance he were joking too broadly. Rosy at last
relieved their suspense and announced, &ldquo;A sofa, just a sofa, now! What do
you say to that? Do you suppose that&rsquo;s an idea that could have come from
any one but her ladyship? She must have all the credit of it; she came out with
it in the course of conversation. I believe we were talking of the peculiar
feeling that comes just under the shoulder-blades if one never has a change.
She mentioned it as she might have mentioned a plaster, or another spoonful of
that American stuff. We are thinking it over, and one of these days, if we give
plenty of time to the question, we shall find the place, the very nicest and
snuggest of all, and no other. I hope <i>you</i> see the connection with the
pink dressing-gown,&rdquo; she remarked to Pinnie, &ldquo;and I hope you see
the importance of the question, Shall anything go? I should like you to look
round a bit, and tell me what you would answer if I were to say to you,
<i>Can</i> anything go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s nothing <i>I</i> should like to part
with,&rdquo; Pinnie returned; and while she surveyed the scene Lady Aurora,
with delicacy, to lighten Amanda&rsquo;s responsibility, got up and turned to
the window, which was open to the summer-evening and admitted still the last
rays of the long day. Hyacinth, after a moment, placed himself beside her,
looking out with her at the dusky multitude of chimney-pots and the small black
houses, roofed with grimy tiles. The thick, warm air of a London July floated
beneath them, suffused with the everlasting uproar of the town, which appeared
to have sunk into quietness but again became a mighty voice as soon as one
listened for it; here and there, in poor windows, glimmered a turbid light, and
high above, in a clearer, smokeless zone, a sky still fair and luminous, a
faint silver star looked down. The sky was the same that, far away in the
country, bent over golden fields and purple hills and gardens where
nightingales sang; but from this point of view everything that covered the
earth was ugly and sordid, and seemed to express, or to represent, the
weariness of toil. In an instant, to Hyacinth&rsquo;s surprise, Lady Aurora
said to him, &ldquo;You never came, after all, to get the books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those you kindly offered to lend me? I didn&rsquo;t know it was an
understanding.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora gave an uneasy laugh. &ldquo;I have picked them out; they are quite
ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you,&rdquo; the young man rejoined. &ldquo;I
will come and get them some day, with pleasure.&rdquo; He was not very sure
that he would; but it was the least he could say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tell you where I live, you know,&rdquo; Lady Aurora went
on, with a movement of her head in the direction of the bed, as if she were too
shy to mention it herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have no doubt she knows the way&mdash;she could tell me every
street and every turn!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has made me describe to her, very often, how I come and go. I think
that few people know more about London than she. She never forgets
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a wonderful little witch&mdash;she terrifies me!&rdquo; said
Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora turned her modest eyes upon him. &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s so good,
she&rsquo;s so patient!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and so wise, and so self-possessed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s immensely clever,&rdquo; said her ladyship. &ldquo;Which
do you think the cleverest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The cleverest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean of the girl and her brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I think he, some day, will be prime minister of England.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you really? I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; cried Lady Aurora, with a flush
of colour in her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you think that will be
possible. You know it ought to be, if things were right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had not professed this high faith for the purpose of playing upon her
ladyship&rsquo;s feelings, but when he perceived her eager responsiveness he
felt almost as if he had been making sport of her. Still, he said no more than
he believed when he remarked, in a moment, that he had the greatest
expectations of Paul Muniment&rsquo;s future: he was sure that the world would
hear of him, that England would feel him, that the public, some day, would
acclaim him. It was impossible to associate with him without feeling that he
was very strong, that he must play an important part.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, people wouldn&rsquo;t believe&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t
believe,&rdquo; Lady Aurora murmured softly, appreciatively. She was evidently
very much pleased with what Hyacinth was saying. It was moreover a pleasure to
himself to place on record his opinion of his friend; it seemed to make that
opinion more clear, to give it the force of an invocation, a prophecy. This was
especially the case when he asked why on earth nature had endowed Paul Muniment
with such extraordinary powers of mind, and powers of body too&mdash;because he
was as strong as a horse&mdash;if it had not been intended that he should do
something great for his fellow-men. Hyacinth confided to her ladyship that he
thought the people in his own class generally very stupid&mdash;what he should
call third-rate minds. He wished it were not so, for heaven knew that he felt
kindly to them and only asked to cast his lot with theirs; but he was obliged
to confess that centuries of poverty, of ill-paid toil, of bad, insufficient
food and wretched homes, had not a favourable effect upon the higher faculties.
All the more reason that when there was a splendid exception, like Paul
Muniment, it should count for a tremendous force&mdash;it had so much to make
up for, to act for. And then Hyacinth repeated that in his own low walk of life
people had really not the faculty of thought; their minds had been
simplified&mdash;reduced to two or three elements. He saw that this declaration
made his interlocutress very uncomfortable; she turned and twisted herself,
vaguely, as if she wished to protest, but she was far too considerate to
interrupt him. He had no desire to distress her, but there were times in which
it was impossible for him to withstand the perverse satisfaction he took in
insisting on his lowliness of station, in turning the knife about in the wound
inflicted by such explicit reference, and in letting it be seen that if his
place in the world was immeasurably small he at least had no illusions about
either himself or his fellows. Lady Aurora replied, as quickly as possible,
that she knew a great deal about the poor&mdash;not the poor like Rose
Muniment, but the terribly, hopelessly poor, with whom she was more familiar
than Hyacinth would perhaps believe&mdash;and that she was often struck with
their great talents, with their quick wit, with their conversation being really
much more entertaining, to her at least, than what one usually heard in
drawing-rooms. She often found them immensely clever.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth smiled at her, and said, &ldquo;Ah, when you get to the lowest depths
of poverty, they may become very brilliant again. But I&rsquo;m afraid I
haven&rsquo;t gone so far down. In spite of my opportunities, I don&rsquo;t
know many absolute paupers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know a great many.&rdquo; Lady Aurora hesitated, as if she
didn&rsquo;t like to boast, and then she added, &ldquo;I dare say I know more
than any one.&rdquo; There was something touching, beautiful, to Hyacinth, in
this simple, diffident admission; it confirmed his impression that Lady Aurora
was in some mysterious, incongruous, and even slightly ludicrous manner a
heroine, a creature of a noble ideal. She perhaps guessed that he was indulging
in reflections that might be favourable to her, for she said, precipitately,
the next minute, as if there were nothing she dreaded so much as the danger of
a compliment, &ldquo;I think your aunt&rsquo;s so very attractive&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m sure Rose Muniment thinks so.&rdquo; No sooner had she spoken than
she blushed again; it appeared to have occurred to her that he might suppose
she wished to contradict him by presenting this case of his aunt as a proof
that the baser sort, even in a prosaic upper layer, were not without redeeming
points. There was no reason why she should not have had this intention; so
without sparing her, Hyacinth replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean that she&rsquo;s an exception to what I was saying?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora stammered a little; then, at last, as if, since he wouldn&rsquo;t
spare her, she wouldn&rsquo;t spare him, either, &ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re
an exception, too; you&rsquo;ll not make me believe you&rsquo;re wanting in
intelligence. The Muniments don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more do I myself; but that doesn&rsquo;t prove that exceptions are
not frequent. I have blood in my veins that is not the blood of the
people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora, sympathetically. And with a smile
she went on: &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re all the more of an exception&mdash;in the
upper class!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her smile was the kindest in the world, but it did not blind Hyacinth to the
fact that from his own point of view he had been extraordinarily indiscreet. He
believed a moment before that he would have been proof against the strongest
temptation to refer to the mysteries of his lineage, inasmuch as, if made in a
boastful spirit (and he had no desire as yet to make it an exercise in
humility), any such reference would inevitably contain an element of the
grotesque. He had never opened his lips to any one about his birth (since the
dreadful days when the question was discussed, with Mr Vetch&rsquo;s
assistance, in Lomax Place); never even to Paul Muniment, never to Millicent
Henning nor to Eustache Poupin. He had an impression that people had ideas
about him, and with some of Miss Henning&rsquo;s he had been made acquainted:
they were of such a nature that he sometimes wondered whether the tie which
united him to her were not, on her own side, a secret determination to satisfy
her utmost curiosity before she had done with him. But he flattered himself
that he was impenetrable, and none the less he had begun to swagger,
idiotically, the first time a temptation (to call a temptation) presented
itself. He turned crimson as soon as he had spoken, partly at the sudden image
of what he had to swagger about, and partly at the absurdity of a challenge
having appeared to proceed from the bashful gentlewoman before him. He hoped
she didn&rsquo;t particularly regard what he had said (and indeed she gave no
sign whatever of being startled by his claim to a pedigree&mdash;she had too
much quick delicacy for that; she appeared to notice only the symptoms of
confusion that followed it), but as soon as possible he gave himself a lesson
in humility by remarking, &ldquo;I gather that you spend most of your time
among the poor, and I am sure you carry blessings with you. But I frankly
confess that I don&rsquo;t understand a lady giving herself up to people like
us when there is no obligation. Wretched company we must be, when there is so
much better to be had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like it very much&mdash;you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely&mdash;that is what I say. Our little friend on the bed is
perpetually talking about your house, your family, your splendours, your
gardens and green-houses; they must be magnificent, of course&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wish she wouldn&rsquo;t; really, I wish she wouldn&rsquo;t. It
makes one feel dreadfully!&rdquo; Lady Aurora interposed, with vehemence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you had better give her her way; it&rsquo;s such a pleasure to
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, more than to any of us!&rdquo; sighed her ladyship, helplessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, how can you leave all those beautiful things, to come and breathe
this beastly air, surround yourself with hideous images, and associate with
people whose smallest fault is that they are ignorant, brutal and dirty? I
don&rsquo;t speak of the ladies here present,&rdquo; Hyacinth added, with the
manner which most made Millicent Henning (who at once admired and hated it)
wonder where on earth he had got it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could make you understand!&rdquo; cried Lady Aurora,
looking at him with troubled, appealing eyes, as if he were unexpectedly
discouraging.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, I do understand! Charity exists in your nature as a kind of
passion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s a kind of passion!&rdquo; her ladyship repeated,
eagerly, very thankful for the word. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether
it&rsquo;s charity&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that. But whatever it is,
it&rsquo;s a passion&mdash;it&rsquo;s my life&mdash;it&rsquo;s all I care
for.&rdquo; She hesitated a moment, as if there might be something indecent in
the confession, or dangerous in the recipient; and then, evidently, she was
mastered by the comfort of being able to justify herself for an eccentricity
that had excited notice, as well as by the luxury of discharging her soul of a
long accumulation of timid, sacred sentiment. &ldquo;Already, when I was
fifteen years old, I wanted to sell all I had and give to the poor. And ever
since, I have wanted to do something; it has seemed as if my heart would break
if I shouldn&rsquo;t be able!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was struck with a great respect, which, however, did not prevent him
(the words sounded patronising, even to himself) from saying in a moment,
&ldquo;I suppose you are very religious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora looked away, into the thickening dusk, at the smutty housetops, the
blurred emanation, above the streets, of lamp-light. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;one has one&rsquo;s ideas&mdash;some of them may be strange. I think
a great many clergymen do good, but there are others I don&rsquo;t like at all.
I dare say we had too many, always, at home; my father likes them so much. I
think I have known too many bishops; I have had the church too much on my back.
I dare say they wouldn&rsquo;t think at home, you know, that one was quite what
one ought to be; but of course they consider me very odd, in every way, as
there&rsquo;s no doubt I am. I should tell you that I don&rsquo;t tell them
everything; for what&rsquo;s the use, when people don&rsquo;t understand? We
are twelve at home, and eight of us are girls; and if you think it&rsquo;s so
very splendid, and <i>she</i> thinks so, I should like you both to try it for a
little! My father isn&rsquo;t rich, and there is only one of us married, and we
are not at all handsome, and&mdash;oh, there are all kinds of things,&rdquo;
the young woman went on, looking round at him an instant, shyly but excitedly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like society; and neither would you if you were to see the
kind there is in London&mdash;at least in some parts,&rdquo; Lady Aurora added,
considerately. &ldquo;I dare say you wouldn&rsquo;t believe all the humbuggery
and the tiresomeness that one has to go through. But I&rsquo;ve got out of it;
I do as I like, though it has been rather a struggle. I have my liberty, and
that is the greatest blessing in life, except the reputation of being queer,
and even a little mad, which is a greater advantage still. I&rsquo;m a little
mad, you know; you needn&rsquo;t be surprised if you hear it. That&rsquo;s
because I stop in town when they go into the country; all the autumn, all the
winter, when there&rsquo;s no one here (except three or four millions), and the
rain drips, drips, drips, from the trees in the big, dull park, where my people
live. I dare say I oughtn&rsquo;t to say such things to you, but, as I tell
you, I&rsquo;m a little mad, and I might as well keep up my character. When one
is one of eight daughters, and there&rsquo;s very little money (for any of us,
at least), and there&rsquo;s nothing to do but to go out with three or four
others in a mackintosh, one can easily go off one&rsquo;s head. Of course
there&rsquo;s the village, and it&rsquo;s not at all a nice one, and there are
the people to look after, and heaven knows they&rsquo;re in want of it; but one
must work with the vicarage, and at the vicarage there are four more daughters,
all old maids, and it&rsquo;s dreary, and it&rsquo;s dreadful, and one has too
much of it, and they don&rsquo;t understand what one thinks or feels, or a
single word one says to them! Besides they <i>are</i> stupid, I admit&mdash;the
country poor; they are very, very dense. I like Camberwell better,&rdquo; said
Lady Aurora, smiling and taking breath, at the end of her nervous, hurried,
almost incoherent speech, of which she had delivered herself pantingly, with
strange intonations and grotesque movements of her neck, as if she were afraid
from one moment to the other that she would repent, not of her confidence, but
of her egotism.
</p>

<p>
It placed her, for Hyacinth, in an unexpected light, and made him feel that her
awkward, aristocratic spinsterhood was the cover of tumultuous passions. No one
could have less the appearance of being animated by a vengeful irony; but he
saw that this delicate, shy, generous, and evidently most tender creature was
not a person to spare, wherever she could prick them, the institutions among
which she had been brought up and against which she had violently reacted.
Hyacinth had always supposed that a reactionary meant a backslider from the
liberal faith, but Rosy&rsquo;s devotee gave a new value to the term; she
appeared to have been driven to her present excesses by the squire and the
parson and the conservative influences of that upper-class British home which
our young man had always supposed to be the highest fruit of civilisation. It
was clear that her ladyship was an original, and an original with force; but it
gave Hyacinth a real pang to hear her make light of Inglefield (especially the
park), and of the opportunities that must have abounded in Belgrave Square. It
had been his belief that in a world of suffering and injustice these things
were, if not the most righteous, at least the most fascinating. If they
didn&rsquo;t give one the finest sensations, where were such sensations to be
had? He looked at Lady Aurora with a face which was a tribute to her sudden
vividness, and said, &ldquo;I can easily understand your wanting to do some
good in the world, because you&rsquo;re a kind of saint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A very curious kind!&rdquo; laughed her ladyship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand your not liking what your position gives
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about my position. I want to live!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And do you call <i>this</i> life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what my position is, if you want to know: it&rsquo;s
the deadness of the grave!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was startled by her tone, but he nevertheless laughed back at her,
&ldquo;Ah, as I say, you&rsquo;re a kind of saint!&rdquo; She made no reply,
for at that moment the door opened, and Paul Muniment&rsquo;s tall figure
emerged from the blackness of the staircase into the twilight, now very faint,
of the room. Lady Aurora&rsquo;s eyes, as they rested upon him, seemed to
declare that such a vision as that, at least, was life. Another person, as tall
as himself, appeared behind him, and Hyacinth recognised with astonishment
their insinuating friend Captain Sholto. Muniment had brought him up for
Rosy&rsquo;s entertainment, being ready, and more than ready, always, to usher
in any one in the world, from the prime minister to the common hangman, who
might give that young lady a sensation. They must have met at the &lsquo;Sun
and Moon&rsquo;, and if the Captain, some accident smoothing the way, had made
him half as many advances as he had made some other people Hyacinth could see
that it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for Paul to lay him under contribution. But
what the mischief was the Captain up to? It cannot be said that our young man
arrived, this evening, at an answer to that question. The occasion proved
highly festal, and the hostess rose to it without lifting her head from the
pillow. Her brother introduced Captain Sholto as a gentleman who had a great
desire to know extraordinary people, and she made him take possession of the
chair at her bedside, out of which Miss Pynsent quickly edged herself, and
asked him who he was, and where he came from, and how Paul had made his
acquaintance, and whether he had many friends in Camberwell. Sholto had not the
same grand air that hovered about him at the theatre; he was shabbily dressed,
very much like Hyacinth himself; but his appearance gave our young man an
opportunity to wonder what made him so unmistakably a gentleman in spite of his
seedy coat and trousers&mdash;in spite too, of his rather overdoing the manner
of being appreciative even to rapture and thinking everything and every one
most charming and curious. He stood out, in poor Rosy&rsquo;s tawdry little
room, among her hideous attempts at decoration, and looked to Hyacinth a being
from another sphere, playing over the place and company a smile (one
couldn&rsquo;t call it false or unpleasant, yet it was distinctly not natural),
of which he had got the habit in camps and courts. It became brilliant when it
rested on Hyacinth, and the Captain greeted him as he might have done a dear
young friend from whom he had been long and painfully separated. He was easy,
he was familiar, he was exquisitely benevolent and bland, and altogether
incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
Rosy was a match for him, however. He evidently didn&rsquo;t puzzle her in the
least; she thought his visit the most natural thing in the world. She expressed
all the gratitude that decency required, but appeared to assume that people who
climbed her stairs would always find themselves repaid. She remarked that her
brother must have met him for the first time that day, for the way that he
sealed a new acquaintance was usually by bringing the person immediately to
call upon her. And when the Captain said that if she didn&rsquo;t like them he
supposed the poor wretches were dropped on the spot, she admitted that this
would be true if it ever happened that she disapproved; as yet, however, she
had not been obliged to draw the line. This was perhaps partly because he had
not brought up any of his political friends&mdash;people that he knew only for
political reasons. Of these people, in general, she had a very small opinion,
and she would not conceal from Captain Sholto that she hoped he was not one of
them. Rosy spoke as if her brother represented the Camberwell district in the
House of Commons and she had discovered that a parliamentary career lowered the
moral tone. The Captain, however, entered quite into her views, and told her
that it was as common friends of Mr Hyacinth Robinson that Mr Muniment and he
had come together; they were both so fond of him that this had immediately
constituted a kind of tie. On hearing himself commemorated in such a brilliant
way Mr Hyacinth Robinson averted himself; he saw that Captain Sholto might be
trusted to make as great an effort for Rosy&rsquo;s entertainment as he
gathered that he had made for that of Millicent Henning, that evening at the
theatre. There were not chairs enough to go round, and Paul fetched a
three-legged stool from his own apartment, after which he undertook to make tea
for the company, with the aid of a tin kettle and a spirit-lamp; these
implements having been set out, flanked by half a dozen cups, in honour,
presumably, of the little dressmaker, who was to come such a distance. The
little dressmaker, Hyacinth observed with pleasure, fell into earnest
conversation with Lady Aurora, who bent over her, flushed, smiling, stammering,
and apparently so nervous that Pinnie, in comparison, was majestic and serene.
They communicated presently to Hyacinth a plan they had unanimously evolved, to
the effect that Miss Pynsent should go home to Belgrave Square with her
ladyship, to settle certain preliminaries in regard to the pink dressing-gown,
toward which, if Miss Pynsent assented, her ladyship hoped to be able to
contribute sundry morsels of stuff which had proved their quality in honourable
service and might be dyed to the proper tint. Pinnie, Hyacinth could see, was
in a state of religious exaltation; the visit to Belgrave Square and the idea
of co-operating in such a manner with the nobility were privileges she could
not take solemnly enough. The latter luxury, indeed, she began to enjoy without
delay; Lady Aurora suggesting that Mr Muniment might be rather awkward about
making tea, and that they should take the business off his hands. Paul gave it
up to them, with a pretence of compassion for their conceit, remarking that at
any rate it took two women to supplant one man; and Hyacinth drew him to the
window, to ask where he had encountered Sholto and how he liked him.
</p>

<p>
They had met in Bloomsbury, as Hyacinth supposed, and Sholto had made up to him
very much as a country curate might make up to an archbishop. He wanted to know
what he thought of this and that: of the state of the labour market at the East
End, of the terrible case of the old woman who had starved to death at Walham
Green, of the practicability of more systematic out-of-door agitation, and the
prospects of their getting one of their own men&mdash;one of the Bloomsbury
lot&mdash;into Parliament. &ldquo;He was mighty civil,&rdquo; Muniment said,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t find that he has picked my pocket. He looked as if he
would like me to suggest that <i>he</i> should stand as one of our own men, one
of the Bloomsbury lot. He asks too many questions, but he makes up for it by
not paying any attention to the answers. He told me he would give the world to
see a working-man&rsquo;s &lsquo;interior&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t know what he
meant at first: he wanted a favourable specimen, one of the best; he had seen
one or two that he didn&rsquo;t believe to be up to the average. I suppose he
meant Schinkel, the cabinet-maker, and he wanted to compare. I told him I
didn&rsquo;t know what sort of a specimen my place would be, but that he was
welcome to look round, and that it contained at any rate one or two original
features. I expect he has found that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;with Rosy and the
noble lady. I wanted to show him off to Rosy; he&rsquo;s good for that, if he
isn&rsquo;t good for anything else. I told him we expected a little company
this evening, so it might be a good time; and he assured me that to mingle in
such an occasion as that was the dream of his existence. He seemed in a rare
hurry, as if I were going to show him a hidden treasure, and insisted on
driving me over in a hansom. Perhaps his idea is to introduce the use of cabs
among the working-classes; certainly, I&rsquo;ll vote for him for Parliament,
if that&rsquo;s his line. On our way over he talked to me about you; told me
you were an intimate friend of his.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did he say about me?&rdquo; Hyacinth inquired, with promptness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Vain little beggar!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he call me that?&rdquo; said Hyacinth, ingenuously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said you were simply astonishing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply astonishing?&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For a person of your low extraction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I may be queer, but he is certainly queerer. Don&rsquo;t you think
so, now you know him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment looked at his young friend a moment. &ldquo;Do you want to know
what he is? He&rsquo;s a tout.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A tout? What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, a cat&rsquo;s-paw, if you like better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stared. &ldquo;For whom, pray?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or a fisherman, if you like better still. I give you your choice of
comparisons. I made them up as we came along in the hansom. He throws his nets
and hauls in the little fishes&mdash;the pretty little shining, wriggling
fishes. They are all for her; she swallows &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For her? Do you mean the Princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who else should I mean? Take care, my tadpole!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I take care? The other day you told me not to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I remember. But now I see more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he speak of her? What did he say?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now what he said, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
guessed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They had been talking, of course, in a very low tone, and their voices were
covered by Rosy&rsquo;s chatter in the corner, by the liberal laughter with
which Captain Sholto accompanied it, and by the much more discreet, though
earnest, intermingled accents of Lady Aurora and Miss Pynsent. But Paul
Muniment spoke more softly still&mdash;Hyacinth felt a kind of
suspense&mdash;as he replied in a moment, &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s a
monster!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A monster?&rdquo; repeated our young man, from whom, this evening, Paul
Muniment seemed destined to elicit ejaculations and echoes.
</p>

<p>
Muniment glanced toward the Captain, who was apparently more and more
fascinated by Rosy. &ldquo;In him I think there&rsquo;s no great harm.
He&rsquo;s only a conscientious fisherman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It must be admitted that Captain Sholto justified to a certain extent this
definition by the manner in which he baited his hook for such little facts as
might help him to a more intimate knowledge of his host and hostess. When the
tea was made, Rose Muniment asked Miss Pynsent to be so good as to hand it
about. They must let her poor ladyship rest a little, must they not?&mdash;and
Hyacinth could see that in her innocent but inveterate self-complacency she
wished to reward and encourage the dressmaker, draw her out and present her
still more, by offering her this graceful exercise. Sholto sprang up at this,
and begged Pinnie to let him relieve her, taking a cup from her hand; and poor
Pinnie, who perceived in a moment that he was some kind of masquerading
gentleman, who was bewildered by the strange mixture of elements that
surrounded her and unused to being treated like a duchess (for the
Captain&rsquo;s manner was a triumph of respectful gallantry), collapsed, on
the instant, into a chair, appealing to Lady Aurora with a frightened smile and
conscious that, deeply versed as she might be in the theory of decorum, she had
no precedent that could meet such an occasion. &ldquo;Now, how many families
would there be in such a house as this, and what should you say about the
sanitary arrangements? Would there be others on this floor&mdash;what is it,
the third, the fourth?&mdash;beside yourselves, you know, and should you call
it a fair specimen of a tenement of its class?&rdquo; It was with such
inquiries as this that Captain Sholto beguiled their tea-drinking, while
Hyacinth made the reflection that, though he evidently meant them very well,
they were characterised by a want of fine tact, by too patronising a curiosity.
The Captain requested information as to the position in life, the avocations
and habits, of the other lodgers, the rent they paid, their relations with each
other, both in and out of the family. &ldquo;Now, would there be a good deal of
close packing, do you suppose, and any perceptible want
of&mdash;a&mdash;sobriety?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment, who had swallowed his cup of tea at a single gulp&mdash;there
was no offer of a second&mdash;gazed out of the window into the dark, which had
now come on, with his hands in his pockets, whistling, impolitely, no doubt,
but with brilliant animation. He had the manner of having made over their
visitor altogether to Rosy and of thinking that whatever he said or did it was
all so much grist to her indefatigable little mill. Lady Aurora looked
distressed and embarrassed, and it is a proof of the degree to which our little
hero had the instincts of a man of the world that he guessed exactly how vulgar
she thought this new acquaintance. She was doubtless rather vexed,
also&mdash;Hyacinth had learned this evening that Lady Aurora could be
vexed&mdash;at the alacrity of Rosy&rsquo;s responses; the little person in the
bed gave the Captain every satisfaction, considered his questions as a proper
tribute to humble respectability, and supplied him, as regards the population
of Audley Court, with statistics and anecdotes which she had picked up by
mysterious processes of her own. At last Lady Aurora, upon whom Paul Muniment
had not been at pains to bestow much conversation, took leave of her, and
signified to Hyacinth that for the rest of the evening she would assume the
care of Miss Pynsent. Pinnie looked very tense and solemn, now that she was
really about to be transported to Belgrave Square, but Hyacinth was sure she
would acquit herself only the more honourably; and when he offered to call for
her there, later, she reminded him, under her breath, with a little sad smile,
of the many years during which, after nightfall, she had carried her work,
pinned up in a cloth, about London.
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment, according to his habit, lighted Lady Aurora downstairs, and
Captain Sholto and Hyacinth were alone for some minutes with Rosy; which gave
the former, taking up his hat and stick, an opportunity to say to his young
friend, &ldquo;Which way are you going? Not my way, by chance?&rdquo; Hyacinth
saw that he hoped for his company, and he became conscious that, strangely as
Muniment had indulged him and too promiscuously investigating as he had just
shown himself, this ingratiating personage was not more easy to resist than he
had been the other night at the theatre. The Captain bent over Rosy&rsquo;s bed
as if she had been a fine lady on a satin sofa, promising to come back very
soon and very often, and the two men went downstairs. On their way they met
Paul Muniment coming up, and Hyacinth felt rather ashamed, he could scarcely
tell why, that his friend should see him marching off with the
&lsquo;tout&rsquo;. After all, if Muniment had brought him to see his sister,
might not he at least walk with him? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming again, you know,
very often. I dare say you&rsquo;ll find me a great bore!&rdquo; the Captain
announced, as he bade good-night to his host. &ldquo;Your sister is a most
interesting creature, one of the most interesting creatures I have ever seen,
and the whole thing, you know, exactly the sort of thing I wanted to get at,
only much more&mdash;really, much more&mdash;original and curious. It has been
a great success, a grand success!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the Captain felt his way down the dusky shaft, while Paul Muniment, above,
gave him the benefit of rather a wavering candlestick, and answered his civil
speech with an &ldquo;Oh, well, you take us as you find us, you know!&rdquo;
and an outburst of frank but not unfriendly laughter.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later Hyacinth found himself in Captain Sholto&rsquo;s chambers,
seated on a big divan covered with Persian rugs and cushions and smoking the
most delectable cigar that had ever touched his lips. As they left Audley Court
the Captain had taken his arm, and they had walked along together in a
desultory, colloquial manner, till on Westminster Bridge (they had followed the
embankment, beneath St Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital) Sholto said, &ldquo;By the way,
why shouldn&rsquo;t you come home with me and see my little place? I&rsquo;ve
got a few things that might amuse you&mdash;some pictures, some odds and ends
I&rsquo;ve picked up, and a few bindings; you might tell me what you think of
them.&rdquo; Hyacinth assented, without hesitation; he had still in his ear the
reverberation of the Captain&rsquo;s inquiries in Rose Muniment&rsquo;s room,
and he saw no reason why he, on his side, should not embrace an occasion of
ascertaining how, as his companion would have said, a man of fashion would live
now.
</p>

<p>
This particular specimen lived in a large, old-fashioned house in Queen Anne
Street, of which he occupied the upper floors, and whose high, wainscoted rooms
he had filled with the spoils of travel and the ingenuities of modern taste.
There was not a country in the world he did not appear to have ransacked, and
to Hyacinth his trophies represented a wonderfully long purse. The whole
establishment, from the low-voiced, inexpressive valet who, after he had poured
brandy into tall tumblers, gave dignity to the popping of soda-water corks, to
the quaint little silver receptacle in which he was invited to deposit the
ashes of his cigar, was such a revelation for our appreciative hero that he
felt himself hushed and made sad, so poignant was the thought that it took
thousands of things which he, then, should never possess nor know to make an
accomplished man. He had often, in evening-walks, wondered what was behind the
walls of certain spacious, bright-windowed houses in the West End, and now he
got an idea. The first effect of the idea was to overwhelm him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, now, tell me what you thought of our friend the Princess,&rdquo;
the Captain said, thrusting out the loose yellow slippers which his servant had
helped to exchange for his shoes. He spoke as if he had been waiting
impatiently for the proper moment to ask that question, so much might depend on
the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful&mdash;beautiful,&rdquo; Hyacinth answered, almost
dreamily, with his eyes wandering all over the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was so interested in all you said to her; she would like so much to
see you again. She means to write to you&mdash;I suppose she can address to the
&lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;?&mdash;and I hope you&rsquo;ll go to her house, if
she proposes a day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. It seems so strange.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What seems strange, my dear fellow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything! My sitting here with you; my introduction to that lady; the
idea of her wanting, as you say, to see me again, and of her writing to me; and
this whole place of yours, with all these dim, rich curiosities hanging on the
walls and glinting in the light of that rose-coloured lamp. You yourself,
too&mdash;you are strangest of all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Captain looked at him, in silence, so fixedly for a while, through the
fumes of their tobacco, after he had made this last charge, that Hyacinth
thought he was perhaps offended; but this impression was presently dissipated
by further manifestations of sociability and hospitality, and Sholto took
occasion, later, to let him know how important it was, in the days they were
living in, not to have too small a measure of the usual, destined as they
certainly were&mdash;&ldquo;in the whole matter of the relations of class with
class, and all that sort of thing, you know&rdquo;&mdash;to witness some very
startling developments. The Captain spoke as if, for his part, he were a child
of his age (so that he only wanted to see all it could show him), down to the
point of his yellow slippers. Hyacinth felt that he himself had not been very
satisfactory about the Princess; but as his nerves began to tremble a little
more into tune with the situation he repeated to his host what Millicent
Henning had said about her at the theatre&mdash;asked if this young lady had
correctly understood him in believing that she had been turned out of the house
by her husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he literally pushed her into the street&mdash;or into the garden; I
believe the scene took place in the country. But perhaps Miss Henning
didn&rsquo;t mention, or perhaps I didn&rsquo;t mention, that the Prince would
at the present hour give everything he owns in the world to get her back. Fancy
such a scene!&rdquo; said the Captain, laughing in a manner that struck
Hyacinth as rather profane.
</p>

<p>
He stared, with dilated eyes, at this picture, which seemed to evoke a
comparison with the only incident of the sort that had come within his
experience&mdash;the forcible ejection of intoxicated females from public
houses. &ldquo;That magnificent being&mdash;what had she done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she had made him feel he was an ass!&rdquo; the Captain answered,
promptly. He turned the conversation to Miss Henning; said he was so glad
Hyacinth gave him an opportunity to speak of her. He got on with her famously;
perhaps she had told him. They became immense friends&mdash;<i>en tout bien
tout honneur, s&rsquo;entend</i>. Now, <i>there</i> was another London type,
plebeian but brilliant; and how little justice one usually did it, how
magnificent it was! But she, of course, was a wonderful specimen. &ldquo;My
dear fellow, I have seen many women, and the women of many countries,&rdquo;
the Captain went on, &ldquo;and I have seen them intimately, and I know what I
am talking about; and when I tell you that that one&mdash;that
one&mdash;&rdquo; Then he suddenly paused, laughing in his democratic way.
&ldquo;But perhaps I am going too far: you must always pull me up, you know,
when I do. At any rate, I congratulate you; I do, heartily. Have another cigar.
Now what sort of&mdash;a&mdash;salary would she receive at her big shop, you
know? I know where it is; I mean to there and buy some
pocket-handkerchiefs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth knew neither how far Captain Sholto had been going, nor exactly on
what he congratulated him; and he pretended, at least, an equal ignorance on
the subject of Millicent&rsquo;s salary. He didn&rsquo;t want to talk about
her, moreover, nor about his own life; he wanted to talk about the
Captain&rsquo;s, and to elicit information that would be in harmony with his
romantic chambers, which reminded our hero somehow of Bulwer&rsquo;s novels.
His host gratified this desire most liberally, and told him twenty stories of
things that had happened to him in Albania, in Madagascar, and even in Paris.
Hyacinth induced him easily to talk about Paris (from a different point of view
from M. Poupin&rsquo;s), and sat there drinking in enchantments. The only thing
that fell below the high level of his entertainment was the bindings of the
Captain&rsquo;s books, which he told him frankly, with the conscience of an
artist, were not very good. After he left Queen Anne Street he was quite too
excited to go straight home; he walked about with his mind full of images and
strange speculations, till the gray London streets began to grow clear with the
summer dawn.

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap16"></a>XVI</h3>

<p>
The aspect of South Street, Mayfair, on a Sunday afternoon in August, is not
enlivening, yet the Prince had stood for ten minutes gazing out of the window
at the genteel vacancy of the scene; at the closed blinds of the opposite
houses, the lonely policeman on the corner, covering a yawn with a white cotton
hand, the low-pitched light itself, which seemed conscious of an obligation to
observe the decency of the British Sabbath. The Prince, however, had a talent
for that kind of attitude; it was one of the things by which he had exasperated
his wife; he could remain motionless, with the aid of some casual support for
his high, lean person, considering serenely and inexpressively any object that
might lie before him and presenting his aristocratic head at a favourable
angle, for periods of extraordinary length. On first coming into the room he
had given some attention to its furniture and decorations, perceiving at a
glance that they were rich and varied; some of the things he recognised as old
friends, odds and ends the Princess was fond of, which had accompanied her in
her remarkable wanderings, while others were unfamiliar, and suggested vividly
that she had not ceased to &lsquo;collect&rsquo;. The Prince made two
reflections: one was that she was living as expensively as ever; the other
that, however this might be, no one had such a feeling as she for the
<i>mise-en-scène</i> of life, such a talent for arranging a room. She had still
the most charming salon in Europe.
</p>

<p>
It was his impression that she had taken the house in South Street but for
three months; yet, gracious heaven, what had she not put into it? The Prince
asked himself this question without violence, for that was not to be his line
to-day. He could be angry to a point at which he himself was often frightened,
but he honestly believed that this was only when he had been baited beyond
endurance and that as a usual thing he was really as mild and accommodating as
the extreme urbanity of his manner appeared to announce. There was indeed
nothing to suggest to the world in general that he was an impracticable or
vindictive nobleman: his features were not regular, and his complexion had a
bilious tone; but his dark brown eye, which was at once salient and dull,
expressed benevolence and melancholy; his head drooped from his long neck in a
considerate, attentive style; and his close-cropped black hair, combined with a
short, fine, pointed beard, completed his resemblance to some old portrait of a
personage of distinction under the Spanish dominion at Naples. To-day, at any
rate, he had come in conciliation, almost in humility, and that is why he did
not permit himself even to murmur at the long delay to which he was subjected.
He knew very well that if his wife should consent to take him back it would be
only after a probation to which this little wait in her drawing-room was a
trifle. It was a quarter of an hour before the door opened, and even then it
was not the Princess who appeared, but only Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
Their greeting was a very silent one. She came to him with both hands
outstretched, and took his own and held them awhile, looking up at him in a
kindly, motherly manner. She had elongated her florid, humorous face to a
degree that was almost comical, and the pair might have passed, in their
speechless solemnity, for acquaintances meeting in a house in which a funeral
was about to take place. It was indeed a house on which death had descended, as
he very soon learned from Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s expression; something had
perished there for ever, and he might proceed to bury it as soon as he liked.
His wife&rsquo;s ancient German friend, however, was not a person to keep up a
manner of that sort very long, and when, after she had made him sit down on the
sofa beside her, she shook her head, slowly and definitely, several times, it
was with a face in which a more genial appreciation of the circumstances had
already begun to appear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never&mdash;never&mdash;never?&rdquo; said the Prince, in a deep, hoarse
voice, which was at variance with his aristocratic slimness. He had much of the
aspect which, in late-coming members of long-descended races, we qualify to-day
as effete; but his speech might have been the speech of some deep-chested
fighting ancestor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely you know your wife as well as I,&rdquo; she replied, in Italian,
which she evidently spoke with facility, though with a strong guttural accent.
&ldquo;I have been talking with her: that is what has made me keep you. I have
urged her to see you. I have told her that this could do no harm and would
pledge her to nothing. But you know your wife,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni repeated,
with a smile which was now distinctly facetious.
</p>

<p>
Prince Casamassima looked down at his boots. &ldquo;How can one ever know a
person like that? I hoped she would see me for five minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For what purpose? Have you anything to propose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For what purpose? To rest my eyes on her beautiful face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you come to England for that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For what else should I have come?&rdquo; the Prince inquired, turning
his blighted gaze to the opposite side of South Street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In London, such a day as this, <i>già</i>,&rdquo; said the old lady,
sympathetically. &ldquo;I am very sorry for you; but if I had known you were
coming I would have written to you that you might spare yourself the
pain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince gave a low, interminable sigh. &ldquo;You ask me what I wish to
propose. What I wish to propose is that my wife does not kill me inch by
inch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She would be much more likely to do that if you lived with her!&rdquo;
Madame Grandoni cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Cara signora</i>, she doesn&rsquo;t appear to have killed you,&rdquo;
the melancholy nobleman rejoined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, me? I am past killing. I am as hard as a stone. I went through my
miseries long ago; I suffered what you have not had to suffer; I wished for
death many times, and I survived it all. Our troubles don&rsquo;t kill us,
Prince; it is we who must try to kill them. I have buried not a few. Besides
Christina is fond of me, God knows why!&rdquo; Madame Grandoni added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you are so good to her,&rdquo; said the Prince, laying his hand on
her fat, wrinkled fist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Che vuole?</i> I have known her so long. And she has some such great
qualities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, to whom do you say it?&rdquo; And Prince Casamassima gazed at his
boots again, for some moments, in silence. Suddenly he inquired, &ldquo;How
does she look to-day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She always looks the same: like an angel who came down from heaven
yesterday and has been rather disappointed in her first day on earth!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince was evidently a man of a simple nature, and Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s
rather violent metaphor took his fancy. His face lighted up for a moment, and
he replied with eagerness, &ldquo;Ah, she is the only woman I have ever seen
whose beauty never for a moment falls below itself. She has no bad days. She is
so handsome when she is angry!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is very handsome to-day, but she is not angry,&rdquo; said the old
lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not when my name was announced?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was not with her then; but when she sent for me and asked me to see
you, it was quite without passion. And even when I argued with her, and tried
to persuade her (and she doesn&rsquo;t like that, you know), she was still
perfectly quiet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She hates me, she despises me too much, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I tell, dear Prince, when she never mentions you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never, never?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better than if she railed at you and abused
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean it should give me more hope for the future?&rdquo; the young
man asked, quickly.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni hesitated a moment. &ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s better for
me,&rdquo; she answered, with a laugh of which the friendly ring covered as
much as possible her equivocation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you like me enough to care,&rdquo; he murmured, turning on her his
sad, grateful eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very sorry for you. <i>Ma che vuole?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince had, apparently, nothing to suggest, and he only exhaled, in reply,
another gloomy groan. Then he inquired whether his wife pleased herself in that
country, and whether she intended to pass the summer in London. Would she
remain long in England, and&mdash;might he take the liberty to ask?&mdash;what
were her plans? Madame Grandoni explained that the Princess had found the
British metropolis much more to her taste than one might have expected, and
that as for plans, she had as many, or as few, as she had always had. Had he
ever known her to carry out any arrangement, or to do anything, of any kind,
she had selected or determined upon? She always, at the last moment, did the
other thing, the one that had been out of the question; and it was for this
that Madame Grandoni herself privately made her preparations. Christina, now
that everything was over, would leave London from one day to the other; but
they should not know where they were going until they arrived. The old lady
concluded by asking the Prince if he himself liked England. He thrust forward
his thick lips. &ldquo;How can I like anything? Besides, I have been here
before: I have friends,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
His companion perceived that he had more to say to her, to extract from her,
but that he was hesitating nervously, because he feared to incur some warning,
some rebuff, with which his dignity&mdash;which, in spite of his position of
discomfiture, was really very great&mdash;might find it difficult to square
itself. He looked vaguely round the room, and presently he remarked, &ldquo;I
wanted to see for myself how she is living.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is very natural.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard&mdash;I have heard&mdash;&rdquo; and Prince Casamassima
stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have heard great rubbish, I have no doubt.&rdquo; Madame Grandoni
watched him, as if she foresaw what was coming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She spends a terrible deal of money,&rdquo; said the young man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed she does.&rdquo; The old lady knew that, careful as he was of his
very considerable property, which at one time had required much nursing, his
wife&rsquo;s prodigality was not what lay heaviest on his mind. She also knew
that expensive and luxurious as Christina might be she had never yet exceeded
the income settled upon her by the Prince at the time of their
separation&mdash;an income determined wholly by himself and his estimate of
what was required to maintain the social consequence of his name, for which he
had a boundless reverence. &ldquo;She thinks she is a model of
thrift&mdash;that she counts every shilling,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni continued.
&ldquo;If there is a virtue she prides herself upon, it&rsquo;s her economy.
Indeed, it&rsquo;s the only thing for which she takes any credit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if she knows that I&rdquo;&mdash;the Prince hesitated a moment,
then he went on&mdash;&ldquo;that I spend really nothing. But I would rather
live on dry bread than that, in a country like this, in this English society,
she should not make a proper appearance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her appearance is all you could wish. How can it help being proper, with
me to set her off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are the best thing she has, dear lady. So long as you are with her I
feel a certain degree of security; and one of the things I came for was to
extract from you a promise that you won&rsquo;t leave her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, let us not tangle ourselves up with promises!&rdquo; Madame Grandoni
exclaimed. &ldquo;You know the value of any engagement one may take with regard
to the Princess; it&rsquo;s like promising you I will stay in the bath when the
hot water is turned on. When I begin to be scalded, I have to jump out! I will
stay while I can; but I shouldn&rsquo;t stay if she were to do certain
things.&rdquo; Madame Grandoni uttered these last words very gravely, and for a
minute she and her companion looked deep into each other&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What things do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what things. It is utterly impossible to predict, on
any occasion, what Christina will do. She is capable of giving us great
surprises. The things I mean are things I should recognise as soon as I saw
them, and they would make me leave the house on the instant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So that if you have not left it yet&mdash;?&rdquo; the Prince asked, in
a low tone, with extreme eagerness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is because I have thought I may do some good by staying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young man seemed only half satisfied with this answer; nevertheless he said
in a moment&mdash;&ldquo;To me it makes all the difference. And if anything of
the kind you speak of should happen, that would be only the greater reason for
your staying&mdash;that you might interpose, that you might
arrest&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short; Madame Grandoni was laughing, with her
Teutonic homeliness, in his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must have been in Rome, more than once, when the Tiber had
overflowed, <i>è vero?</i> What would you have thought then if you had heard
people telling the poor wretches in the Ghetto, on the Ripetta, up to their
knees in liquid mud, that they ought to interpose, to arrest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Capisco bene</i>,&rdquo; said the Prince, dropping his eyes. He
appeared to have closed them, for some moments, as if a slow spasm of pain were
passing through him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what torments me
most,&rdquo; he presently went on, &ldquo;the thought that sometimes makes my
heart rise into my mouth. It&rsquo;s a haunting fear.&rdquo; And his pale face
and disturbed respiration might indeed have been those of a man before whom
some horrible spectre had risen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me. I know what you mean, my poor friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think, then, there <i>is</i> a danger&mdash;that she will drag my
name, do what no one has ever dared to do? That I would never forgive,&rdquo;
said the young man, almost under his breath; and the hoarseness of his whisper
lent a great effect to the announcement.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni wondered for a moment whether she had not better tell him (as
it would prepare him for the worst) that his wife cared about as much for his
name as for any old label on her luggage; but after an instant&rsquo;s
reflection she reserved this information for another hour. Besides, as she said
to herself, the Prince ought already to know perfectly to what extent Christina
attached the idea of an obligation or an interdict to her ill-starred
connection with an ignorant and superstitious Italian race whom she despised
for their provinciality, their parsimony and their tiresomeness (she thought
their talk the climax of puerility), and whose fatuous conception of their
importance in the great modern world she had on various public occasions
sufficiently covered with her derision. The old lady finally contented herself
with remarking, &ldquo;Dear Prince, your wife is a very proud woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, how could my wife be anything else? But her pride is not my pride.
And she has such ideas, such opinions! Some of them are monstrous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni smiled. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t think it so necessary to have
them when you are not there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why then do you say that you enter into my fears&mdash;that you
recognise the stories I have heard?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I know not whether the good lady lost patience with his persistence; at all
events, she broke out, with a certain sharpness, &ldquo;Understand
this&mdash;understand this: Christina will never consider you&mdash;your name,
your illustrious traditions&mdash;in any case in which she doesn&rsquo;t
consider, much more, herself!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince appeared to study, for a moment, this somewhat ambiguous yet
portentous phrase; then he slowly got up, with his hat in his hand, and walked
about the room, softly, solemnly, as he were suffering from his long thin feet.
He stopped before one of the windows, and took another survey of South Street;
then, turning, he suddenly inquired, in a voice into which he had evidently
endeavoured to infuse a colder curiosity, &ldquo;Is she admired in this place?
Does she see many people?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is thought very strange, of course. But she sees whom she likes. And
they mostly bore her to death!&rdquo; Madame Grandoni added, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why then do you tell me this country pleases her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni left her place. She had promised Christina, who detested the
sense of being under the same roof with her husband, that the Prince&rsquo;s
visit should be kept within narrow limits; and this movement was intended to
signify as kindly as possible that it had better terminate. &ldquo;It is the
common people that please her,&rdquo; she replied, with her hands folded on her
crumpled satin stomach and her humorous eyes raised to his face. &ldquo;It is
the lower orders, the <i>basso popolo</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The <i>basso popolo?</i>&rdquo; The Prince stared, at this fantastic
announcement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The <i>povera gente</i>,&rdquo; pursued the old lady, laughing at his
amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The London mob&mdash;the most horrible, the most brutal&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she wishes to raise them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, something like that is no more than I had heard,&rdquo; said
the Prince gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Che vuole?</i> Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself; it won&rsquo;t be for
long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni saw that this comforting assurance was lost upon him; his face
was turned to the door of the room, which had been thrown open, and all his
attention was given to the person who crossed the threshold. Madame Grandoni
transferred her own to the same quarter, and recognised the little artisan whom
Christina had, in a manner so extraordinary and so profoundly characteristic,
drawn into her box that night at the theatre, and whom she had since told her
old friend she had sent for to come and see her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Robinson!&rdquo; the butler, who had had a lesson, announced in a
loud, colourless tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for long,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni repeated, for the
Prince&rsquo;s benefit; but it was to Mr Robinson the words had the air of
being addressed.
</p>

<p>
He stood there while Madame Grandoni signalled to the servant to leave the door
open and wait, looking from the queer old lady, who was as queer as before, to
the tall foreign gentleman (he recognised his foreignness at a glance), whose
eyes seemed to challenge him, to devour him; wondering whether he had made some
mistake, and needing to remind himself that he had the Princess&rsquo;s note in
his pocket, with the day and hour as clear as her magnificent handwriting could
make them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning, good-morning. I hope you are well,&rdquo; said Madame
Grandoni, with quick friendliness, but turning her back upon him at the same
time, to ask of the Prince, in Italian, as she extended her hand, &ldquo;And do
you not leave London soon&mdash;in a day or two?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince made no answer; he still scrutinised the little bookbinder from head
to foot, as if he were wondering who the deuce he could be. His eyes seemed to
Hyacinth to search for the small neat bundle he ought to have had under his
arm, and without which he was incomplete. To the reader, however, it may be
confided that, dressed more carefully than he had ever been in his life before,
stamped with that extraordinary transformation which the British Sunday often
operates in the person of the wage-earning cockney, with his handsome head
uncovered and suppressed excitement in his brilliant little face, the young man
from Lomax Place might have passed for anything rather than a carrier of
parcels. &ldquo;The Princess wrote to me, madam, to come and see her,&rdquo; he
remarked, as a precaution, in case he should have incurred the reproach of bad
taste, or at least of precipitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I dare say.&rdquo; And Madame Grandoni guided the Prince to the
door, with an expression of the hope that he would have a comfortable journey
back to Italy.
</p>

<p>
A faint flush had come into his face; he appeared to have satisfied himself on
the subject of Mr Robinson. &ldquo;I must see you once more&mdash;I
must&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, not in this house, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you do me the honour to meet me, then?&rdquo; And as the old lady
hesitated, he added, with sudden passion, &ldquo;Dearest friend, I entreat you
on my knees!&rdquo; After she had agreed that if he would write to her,
proposing a day and place, she would see him, he raised her ancient knuckles to
his lips and, without further notice of Hyacinth, turned away. Madame Grandoni
requested the servant to announce the other visitor to the Princess, and then
approached Mr Robinson, rubbing her hands and smiling, with her head on one
side. He smiled back at her, vaguely; he didn&rsquo;t know what she might be
going to say. What she said was, to his surprise&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor young man, may I take the liberty of asking your age?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, madam; I am twenty-four.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I hope you are industrious, and sober, and&mdash;what do you call it
in English?&mdash;steady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am very wild,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling still.
He thought the old woman patronising, but he forgave her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how one speaks, in this country, to young men like
you. Perhaps one is considered meddling, impertinent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like the way you speak,&rdquo; Hyacinth interposed.
</p>

<p>
She stared, and then with a comical affectation of dignity, replied, &ldquo;You
are very good. I am glad it amuses you. You are evidently intelligent and
clever,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and if you are disappointed it will be a
pity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, if I am disappointed?&rdquo; Hyacinth looked more
grave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I dare say you expect great things, when you come into a house
like this. You must tell me if I wound you. I am very old-fashioned, and I am
not of this country. I speak as one speaks to young men, like you, in other
places.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not so easily wounded!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed, with a flight of
imagination. &ldquo;To expect anything, one must know something, one must
understand: isn&rsquo;t it so? And I am here without knowing, without
understanding. I have come only because a lady who seems to me very beautiful
and very kind has done me the honour to send for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni examined him a moment, as if she were struck by his good looks,
by something delicate that was stamped upon him everywhere. &ldquo;I can see
you are very clever, very intelligent; no, you are not like the young men I
mean. All the more reason&mdash;&rdquo; And she paused, giving a little sigh.
&ldquo;I want to warn you a little, and I don&rsquo;t know how. If you were a
young Roman, it would be different.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A young Roman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I live, properly, in Rome. If I hurt you, you can
explain it that way. No, you are not like them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hurt me&mdash;please believe that; you interest me very
much,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, to whom it did not occur that he himself might
appear patronising. &ldquo;Of what do you want to warn me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;only to advise you a little. Do not give up anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can I give up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not give up <i>yourself</i>. I say that to you in your interest. I
think you have some little trade&mdash;I forget what; but whatever it may be,
remember that to do it well is the best thing&mdash;it is better than paying
visits, better even than a Princess!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah yes, I see what you mean!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed, exaggerating a
little. &ldquo;I am very fond of my trade, I assure you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am delighted to hear it. Hold fast to it, then, and be quiet; be
diligent, and honest, and good. I gathered the other night that you are one of
the young men who want everything changed&mdash;I believe there are a great
many in Italy, and also in my own dear old Deutschland&mdash;and even think
it&rsquo;s useful to throw bombs into innocent crowds, and shoot pistols at
their rulers, or at any one. I won&rsquo;t go into that. I might seem to be
speaking for myself, and the fact is that for myself I don&rsquo;t care; I am
so old that I may hope to spend the few days that are left me without receiving
a bullet. But before you go any further please think a little whether you are
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t just that you should impute to me ideas which I may not
have,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, turning very red, but taking more and more of a
fancy, all the same, to Madame Grandoni. &ldquo;You talk at your ease about our
ways and means, but if we were only to make use of those that you would like to
see&mdash;&rdquo; And while he blushed, smiling, the young man shook his head two or
three times, with great significance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to see any!&rdquo; the old lady cried. &ldquo;I
like people to bear their troubles as one has done one&rsquo;s self. And as for
injustice, you see how kind I am to you when I say to you again, don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t give anything up. I will tell them to send you some tea,&rdquo; she
added, as she took her way out of the room, presenting to him her round, low,
aged back, and dragging over the carpet a scanty and lustreless train.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap17"></a>XVII</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth had been warned by Mr Vetch as to what brilliant women might do with
him (it was only a word on the old fiddler&rsquo;s lips, but the word had had a
point), he had been warned by Paul Muniment, and now he was admonished by a
person supremely well placed for knowing&mdash;a fact that could not fail to
deepen the emotion which, any time these three days, had made him draw his
breath more quickly. That emotion, however, was now not of a kind to make him
fear remote consequences; as he looked over the Princess Casamassima&rsquo;s
drawing-room and inhaled an air that seemed to him inexpressibly delicate and
sweet, he hoped that his adventure would throw him upon his mettle only half as
much as the old lady had wished to intimate. He considered, one after the
other, the different chairs, couches and ottomans the room contained&mdash;he
wished to treat himself to the most sumptuous&mdash;and then, for reasons he
knew best, sank into a seat covered with rose-coloured brocade, of which the
legs and frame appeared to be of pure gold. Here he sat perfectly still, with
only his heart beating very sensibly and his eyes coursing again and again from
one object to another. The splendours and suggestions of Captain Sholto&rsquo;s
apartment were thrown completely into the shade by the scene before him, and as
the Princess did not scruple to keep him waiting for twenty minutes (during
which the butler came in and set out, on a small table, a glittering
tea-service), Hyacinth had time to count over the innumerable <i>bibelots</i>
(most of which he had never dreamed of) involved in the personality of a woman
of high fashion, and to feel that their beauty and oddity revealed not only
whole provinces of art, but refinements of choice, on the part of their owner,
complications of mind, and&mdash;almost&mdash;terrible depths of character.
</p>

<p>
When at last the door opened and the servant, reappearing, threw it far back,
as if to make a wide passage for a person of the importance of his mistress,
Hyacinth&rsquo;s suspense became very acute; it was much the same feeling with
which, at the theatre, he had sometimes awaited the entrance of a celebrated
actress. In this case the actress was to perform for him alone. There was still
a moment before she came on, and when she did so she was so simply
dressed&mdash;besides his seeing her now on her feet&mdash;that she looked like
a different person. She approached him rapidly, and a little stiffly and shyly,
but in the manner in which she shook hands with him there was an evident desire
to be frank, and even fraternal. She looked like a different person, but that
person had a beauty even more radiant; the fairness of her face shone forth at
our young man as if to dissipate any doubts that might have crept over him as
to the reality of the vision bequeathed to him by his former interview. And in
this brightness and richness of her presence he could not have told you whether
she struck him as more proud or more kind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have kept you a long time, but it&rsquo;s supposed not, usually, to be
a bad place, my salon; there are various things to look at, and perhaps you
have noticed them. Over on that side, for instance, there is rather a curious
collection of miniatures.&rdquo; She spoke abruptly, quickly, as if she were
conscious that their communion might be awkward and she were trying to strike,
instantly (to conjure that element away), the sort of note that would make them
both most comfortable. Quickly, too, she sat down before her tea-tray and
poured him out a cup, which she handed him without asking whether he would have
it. He accepted it with a trembling hand, though he had no desire for it; he
was too nervous to swallow the tea, but it would not have occurred to him that
it was possible to decline. When he had murmured that he had indeed looked at
all her things but that it would take hours to do justice to such treasures,
she asked if he were fond of works of art; adding, however, immediately, that
she was afraid he had not many opportunities of seeing them, though of course
there were the public collections, open to all. Hyacinth said, with perfect
veracity, that some of the happiest moments of his life had been spent at the
British Museum and the National Gallery, and this reply appeared to interest
her greatly, so that she immediately begged him to tell her what he thought of
certain pictures and antiques. In this way it was that in an incredibly short
space of time, as it appeared to him, he found himself discussing the Bacchus
and Ariadne and the Elgin marbles with one of the most remarkable woman in
Europe. It is true that she herself talked most, passing precipitately from one
point to another, asking him questions and not waiting for answers; describing
and qualifying things, expressing feelings, by the aid of phrases that he had
never heard before but which seemed to him illuminating and happy&mdash;as
when, for instance, she asked what art was, after all, but a synthesis made in
the interest of pleasure, or said that she didn&rsquo;t like England at all,
but loved it. It did not occur to him to think these discriminations pedantic.
Suddenly she remarked, &ldquo;Madame Grandoni told me you saw my
husband.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, was the gentleman your husband?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unfortunately! What do you think of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I couldn&rsquo;t, either! I haven&rsquo;t seen him for nearly
three years. He wanted to see me to-day, but I refused.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Hyacinth, staring and not knowing how he ought to
receive so unexpected a confidence. Then, as the suggestions of inexperience
are sometimes the happiest of all, he spoke simply what was in his mind and
said, gently, &ldquo;It has made you very nervous.&rdquo; Afterwards, when he
had left the house, he wondered how, at that stage, he could have ventured on
such a familiar remark.
</p>

<p>
The Princess took it with a quick, surprised laugh. &ldquo;How do you know
that?&rdquo; But before he had time to tell how, she added, &ldquo;Your saying
that&mdash;that way&mdash;shows me how right I was to ask you to come to see
me. You know, I hesitated. It shows me you have perceptions; I guessed as much
the other night at the theatre. If I hadn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t have asked
you. I may be wrong, but I like people who understand what one says to them,
and also what one doesn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I understand too much. You might easily exaggerate
that,&rdquo; Hyacinth declared, conscientiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You confirm, completely, my first impression,&rdquo; the Princess
returned, smiling in a way that showed him he really amused her. &ldquo;We
shall discover the limits of your comprehension! I <i>am</i> atrociously
nervous. But it will pass. How is your friend the dressmaker?&rdquo; she
inquired, abruptly. And when Hyacinth had briefly given some account of poor
Pinnie&mdash;told her that she was tolerably well for her, but old and tired
and sad, and not very successful&mdash;she exclaimed, impatiently, &ldquo;Ah,
well, she&rsquo;s not the only one!&rdquo; and came back, with irrelevance, to
the former question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only my husband&rsquo;s
visit&mdash;absolutely unexpected!&mdash;that has made me fidgety, but the idea
that now you have been so kind as to come here you may wonder why, after all, I
made such a point of it, and even think any explanation I might be able to give
you entirely insufficient.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any explanation,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of you to say that, and I shall take you at your
word. Explanations usually make things worse. All the same, I don&rsquo;t want
you to think (as you might have done so easily the other evening) that I wish
only to treat you as a curious animal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how you treat me!&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling.
</p>

<p>
There was a considerable silence, after which the Princess remarked, &ldquo;All
I ask of my husband is to let me alone. But he won&rsquo;t. He won&rsquo;t
reciprocate my indifference.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth asked himself what reply he ought to make to such an announcement as
that, and it seemed to him that the least civility demanded was that he should
say&mdash;as he could with such conviction&mdash;&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be easy
to be indifferent to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not, if I am odious? I can be&mdash;oh, there is no doubt of that!
However, I can honestly say that with the Prince I have been exceedingly
reasonable, and that most of the wrongs&mdash;the big ones, those that settled
the question&mdash;have been on his side. You may tell me of course that
that&rsquo;s the pretension of every woman who has made a mess of her marriage.
But ask Madame Grandoni.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will tell me it&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very true&mdash;she might!&rdquo; the Princess admitted, laughing.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know, either, why I should talk to you about my
domestic affairs; except that I have been wondering what I could do to show
confidence in you, in return for your showing so much in me. As this matter of
my separation from my husband happens to have been turned uppermost by his
sudden descent upon me, I just mention it, though the subject is tiresome
enough. Moreover I ought to let you know that I have very little respect for
distinctions of class&mdash;the sort of thing they make so much of in this
country. They are doubtless convenient in some ways, but when one has a
reason&mdash;a reason of feeling&mdash;for overstepping them, and one allows
one&rsquo;s self to be deterred by some dreary superstition about one&rsquo;s
place, or some one else&rsquo;s place, then I think it&rsquo;s ignoble. It
always belongs to one&rsquo;s place not to be a poor creature. I take it that
if you are a socialist you think about this as I do; but lest, by chance, as
the sense of those differences is the English religion, it may have rubbed off
even on you, though I am more and more impressed with the fact that you are
scarcely more British than I am; lest you should, in spite of your theoretic
democracy, be shocked at some of the applications that I, who cherish the
creed, am capable of making of it, let me assure you without delay that in that
case we shouldn&rsquo;t get on together at all, and had better part company
before we go further.&rdquo; She paused, long enough for Hyacinth to declare,
with a great deal of emphasis, that he was not easily shocked; and then,
restlessly, eagerly, as if it relieved her to talk, and made their queer
interview less abnormal that she should talk most, she arrived at the point
that she wanted to know the <i>people</i>, and know them intimately&mdash;the
toilers and strugglers and sufferers&mdash;because she was convinced they were
the most interesting portion of society, and at the inquiry, &ldquo;What could
possibly be in worse taste than for me to carry into such an undertaking a
pretension of greater delicacy and finer manners? If I must do that,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simpler to leave them alone. But I can&rsquo;t
leave them alone; they press upon me, they haunt me, they fascinate me. There
it is (after all, it&rsquo;s very simple): I want to know them, and I want you
to help me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will help you with pleasure, to the best of my humble ability. But you
will be awfully disappointed,&rdquo; Hyacinth said. Very strange it seemed to
him that within so few days two ladies of rank should have found occasion to
express to him the same mysterious longing. A breeze from a thoroughly
unexpected quarter was indeed blowing over the aristocracy. Nevertheless,
though there was much of the accent of passion in the Princess
Casamassima&rsquo;s communication that there had been in Lady Aurora&rsquo;s,
and though he felt bound to discourage his present interlocutress as he had
done the other, the force that pushed her struck him as a very different
mixture from the shy, conscientious, anxious heresies of Rose Muniment&rsquo;s
friend. The temper varied in the two women as much as the face and the manner,
and that perhaps made their curiosity the more significant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt of it: there is nothing in life in which
I have not been awfully disappointed. But disappointment for disappointment I
shall like it better than some others. You&rsquo;ll not persuade me, either,
that among the people I speak of, characters and passions and motives are not
more natural, more complete, more <i>naïf</i>. The upper classes are so
insipid! My husband traces his descent from the fifth century, and he&rsquo;s
the greatest bore on earth. That is the kind of people I was condemned to live
with after my marriage. Oh, if you knew what I have been through, you would
allow that intelligent mechanics (of course I don&rsquo;t want to know idiots)
would be a pleasant change. I must begin with some one&mdash;mustn&rsquo;t
I?&mdash;so I began, the other night, with you!&rdquo; As soon as she had
uttered these words the Princess added a correction, with the consciousness of
her mistake in her face. It made that face, to Hyacinth, more nobly, tenderly
pure. &ldquo;The only objection to you, individually, is that you have nothing
of the people about you&mdash;to-day not even the dress.&rdquo; Her eyes
wandered over him from head to foot, and their friendly beauty made him
ashamed. &ldquo;I wish you had come in the clothes you wear at your
work!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see you do regard me as a curious animal,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps to contradict this that, after a moment, she began to tell him
more about her domestic affairs. He ought to know who she was, unless Captain
Sholto had told him; and she related her parentage&mdash;American on the
mother&rsquo;s side, Italian on the father&rsquo;s&mdash;and how she had led,
in her younger years, a wandering, Bohemian life, in a thousand different
places (always in Europe; she had never been in America and knew very little
about it, though she wanted greatly to cross the Atlantic), and largely, at one
period, in Rome. She had been married by her people, in a mercenary way, for
the sake of a fortune and a title, and it had turned out as badly as her worst
enemy could wish. Her parents were dead, luckily for them, and she had no one
near her of her own except Madame Grandoni, who belonged to her only in the
sense that she had known her as a girl; was an association of her&mdash;what
should she call them?&mdash;her innocent years. Not that she had ever been very
innocent; she had had a horrible education. However, she had known a few good
people&mdash;people she respected, then; but Madame Grandoni was the only one
who had stuck to her. She, too, was liable to leave her any day; the Princess
appeared to intimate that her destiny might require her to take some step which
would test severely the old lady&rsquo;s adhesive property. It would detain her
too long to make him understand the stages by which she had arrived at her
present state of mind: her disgust with a thousand social arrangements, her
rebellion against the selfishness, the corruption, the iniquity, the cruelty,
the imbecility, of the people who, all over Europe, had the upper hand. If he
could have seen her life, the <i>milieu</i> in which, for several years, she
had been condemned to move, the evolution of her opinions (Hyacinth was
delighted to hear her use that term) would strike him as perfectly logical. She
had been humiliated, outraged, tortured; she considered that she too was one of
the numerous class who could be put on a tolerable footing only by a
revolution. At any rate, she had some self-respect left, and there was still
more that she wanted to recover; the only way to arrive at that was to throw
herself into some effort which would make her forget her own affairs and
comprehend the troubles and efforts of others. Hyacinth listened to her with a
wonderment which, as she went on, was transformed into fascinated submission;
she seemed so natural, so vivid, so exquisitely generous and sincere. By the
time he had been with her for half an hour she had made the situation itself
appear natural and usual, and a third person who should have joined them at
this moment would have observed nothing to make him suppose that friendly
social intercourse between little bookbinders and Neapolitan princesses was
not, in London, a matter of daily occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had seen plenty of women who chattered about themselves and their
affairs&mdash;a vulgar garrulity of confidence was indeed a leading
characteristic of the sex as he had hitherto learned to know it&mdash;but he
was quick to perceive that the great lady who now took the trouble to open
herself to him was not of a gossiping habit; that she must be, on the contrary,
as a general thing, proudly, ironically, reserved, even to the point of
passing, with many people, for a model of the unsatisfactory. It was very
possible she was capricious; yet the fact that her present sympathies and
curiosities might be a caprice wore, in Hyacinth&rsquo;s eyes, no sinister
aspect. Why was it not a noble and interesting whim, and why might he not
stand, for the hour at any rate, in the silvery moonshine it threw upon his
path? It must be added that he was far from understanding everything she said,
and some of her allusions and implications were so difficult to seize that they
mainly served to reveal to him the limits of his own acquaintance with life.
Her words evoked all sorts of shadowy suggestions of things he was condemned
not to know, touching him most when he had not the key to them. This was
especially the case with her reference to her career in Italy, on her
husband&rsquo;s estates, and her relations with his family; who considered that
they had done her a great honour in receiving her into their august circle
(putting the best face on a bad business), after they had moved heaven and
earth to keep her out of it. The position made for her among these people, and
what she had had to suffer from their family tone, their opinions and customs
(though what these might be remained vague to her listener), had evidently
planted in her soul a lasting resentment and contempt; and Hyacinth gathered
that the force of reaction and revenge might carry her far, make her modern and
democratic and heretical <i>à outrance</i>&mdash;lead her to swear by Darwin
and Spencer as well as by the revolutionary spirit. He surely need not have
been so sensible of the weak spots in his comprehension of the Princess, when
he could already surmise that personal passion had counted for so much in the
formation of her views. This induction, however, which had no harshness, did
not make her appear to him any the less a creature compounded of the finest
elements; brilliant, delicate, complicated, but complicated with something
divine. It was not until after he had left her that he became conscious she had
forced him to talk, as well as talked herself. He drew a long breath as he
reflected that he had not made quite such an ass of himself as might very well
have happened; he had been saved by his enjoyment and admiration, which had not
gone to his head and prompted him to show that he too, in his improbable little
way, was remarkable, but had kept him in a state of anxious, delicious tension,
as if the occasion had been a great solemnity. He had said, indeed, much more
than he had warrant for, when she questioned him about his socialistic
affiliations; he had spoken as if the movement were vast and mature, whereas,
in fact, so far, at least, as he was as yet concerned with it, and could answer
for it from personal knowledge, it was circumscribed by the hideously papered
walls of the little club-room at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;. He reproached
himself with this laxity, but it had not been engendered by vanity. He was only
afraid of disappointing his hostess too much; of making her say, &lsquo;Why in
the world, then, did you come to see me, if you have nothing more remarkable to
relate?&rsquo;&mdash;an inquiry to which, of course, he would have had an
answer ready, if it had not been impossible to him to say that he had never
asked to come: his coming was her own affair. He wanted too much to come a
second time to have the courage to make that speech. Nevertheless, when she
exclaimed, changing the subject abruptly, as she always did, from something
else they had been talking about, &ldquo;I wonder whether I shall ever see you
again!&rdquo;, he replied, with perfect sincerity, that it was very difficult
for him to believe anything so delightful could be repeated. There were some
kinds of happiness that to many people never came at all, and to others could
come only once. He added, &ldquo;It is very true I had just that feeling after
I left you the other night at the theatre. And yet here I am!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there you are,&rdquo; said the Princess thoughtfully, as if this
might be a still graver and more embarrassing fact than she had yet supposed
it. &ldquo;I take it there is nothing essentially impossible in my seeing you
again; but it may very well be that you will never again find it so pleasant.
Perhaps that&rsquo;s the happiness that comes but once. At any rate, you know,
I am going away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, of course; every one leaves town,&rdquo; Hyacinth commented,
sagaciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you, Mr Robinson?&rdquo; asked the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t as a general thing. Nevertheless, it is possible
that, this year, I may get two or three days at the seaside. I should like to
take my old lady. I have done it before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And except for that you shall be always at work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but you must understand that I like my work. You must understand
that it&rsquo;s a great blessing for a young fellow like me to have it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if you didn&rsquo;t have it, what would you do? Should you
starve?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I should starve,&rdquo; the young man replied,
judicially.
</p>

<p>
The Princess looked a little chagrined, but after a moment she remarked,
&ldquo;I wonder whether you would come to see me, in the country,
somewhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed, catching his breath. &ldquo;You are
so kind, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be <i>banal</i>, please. That&rsquo;s what other people are.
What&rsquo;s the use of my looking for something fresh in other walks of life,
if you are going to be <i>banal</i> too? I ask you, would you come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Yes, I think I would come. I don&rsquo;t
know, at all, how I should do it&mdash;there would be several obstacles; but
wherever you should call for me, I would come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean you can&rsquo;t leave your work, like that; you might lose it,
if you did, and be in want of money and much embarrassed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there would be little difficulties of that kind. You see that
immediately, in practice, great obstacles come up, when it&rsquo;s a question
of a person like you making friends with a person like me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I like you to talk,&rdquo; said the Princess, with
a pitying gentleness that seemed to her visitor quite sacred. &ldquo;After all,
I don&rsquo;t know where I shall be. I have got to pay stupid visits, myself,
where the only comfort will be that I shall make the people jump. Every one
here thinks me exceedingly odd&mdash;as there is no doubt I am! I might be ever
so much more so if you would only help me a little. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I have
my bookbinder, after all? In attendance, you know, it would be awfully
<i>chic</i>. We might have immense fun, don&rsquo;t you think so? No doubt it
will come. At any rate, I shall return to London when I have got through that
<i>corvée;</i> I shall be here next year. In the meantime, don&rsquo;t forget
me,&rdquo; she went on, rising to her feet. &ldquo;Remember, on the contrary,
that I expect you to take me into the slums&mdash;into very bad places.&rdquo;
Why the idea of these scenes of misery should have lighted up her face is more
than may be explained; but she smiled down at Hyacinth&mdash;who, even as he
stood up, was of slightly smaller stature&mdash;with all her strange, radiant
sweetness. Then, in a manner almost equally incongruous, she added a reference
to what she had said a moment before: &ldquo;I recognise perfectly the
obstacles, in practice, as you call them; but though I am not, by nature,
persevering, and am really very easily put off, I don&rsquo;t consider that
they will prove insurmountable. They exist on my side as well, and if you will
help me to overcome mine I will do the same for you, with yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These words, repeating themselves again and again in Hyacinth&rsquo;s
consciousness, appeared to give him wings, to help him to float and soar, as he
turned that afternoon out of South Street. He had at home a copy of
Tennyson&rsquo;s poems&mdash;a single, comprehensive volume, with a double
column on the page, in a tolerably neat condition, though he had handled it
much. He took it to pieces that same evening, and during the following week, in
his hours of leisure, at home in his little room, with the tools he kept there
for private use, and a morsel of delicate, blue-tinted Russia leather, of which
he obtained possession at the place in Soho, he devoted himself to the task of
binding the book as perfectly as he knew how. He worked with passion, with
religion, and produced a masterpiece of firmness and finish, of which his own
appreciation was as high as that of M. Poupin, when, at the end of the week, he
exhibited the fruit of his toil, and much more freely expressed than that of
old Crookenden, who grunted approbation, but was always too long-headed to
create precedents. Hyacinth carried the volume to South Street, as an offering
to the Princess; hoping she would not yet have left London, in which case he
would ask the servant to deliver it to her, along with a little note he had sat
up all night to compose. But the majestic butler, in charge of the house,
opening the door yet looking down at him as if from a second-storey window,
took the life out of his vision and erected himself as an impenetrable medium.
The Princess had been absent for some days; the butler was so good as to inform
the young man with the parcel that she was on a visit to a &lsquo;juke&rsquo;,
in a distant part of the country. He offered however to receive, and even to
forward, anything Hyacinth might wish to leave; but our hero felt a sudden
indisposition to launch his humble tribute into the vast, the possibly cold,
unknown of a ducal circle. He decided to retain his little package for the
present; he would give it to her when he should see her again, and he turned
away without parting with it. Later, it seemed to create a sort of material
link between the Princess and himself, and at the end of three months it almost
appeared to him, not that the exquisite book was an intended present from his
own hand, but that it had been placed in that hand by the most remarkable woman
in Europe. Rare sensations and impressions, moments of acute happiness, almost
always, with Hyacinth, in retrospect, became rather mythic and legendary; and
the superior piece of work he had done after seeing her last, in the immediate
heat of his emotion, turned into a kind of proof and gage, as if a ghost, in
vanishing from sight, had left a palpable relic.

<h3><a name="chap18"></a>XVIII</h3>

<p>
The matter concerned him only indirectly, but it may concern the reader more
closely to know that before the visit to the duke took place Madame Grandoni
granted to Prince Casamassima the private interview she had promised him on
that sad Sunday afternoon. She crept out of South Street after
breakfast&mdash;a repast which under the Princess&rsquo;s roof was served at
twelve o&rsquo;clock, in the foreign fashion&mdash;crossed the sultry solitude
into which, at such a season, that precinct resolves itself, and entered the
Park, where the grass was already brown and a warm, smoky haze prevailed, a
sort of summer edition of what was most characteristic in the London air. The
Prince met her, by appointment, at the gate, and they went and sat down
together under the trees beside the drive, amid a wilderness of empty chairs
and with nothing to distract their attention from an equestrian or two, left
over from the cavalcades of a fortnight before, and whose vain agitation in the
saddle the desolate scene seemed to throw into high relief. They remained there
for nearly an hour, though Madame Grandoni, in spite of her leaning to friendly
interpretations, could not have told herself what comfort it was to the
depressed, embarrassed young man at her side. She had nothing to say to him
which could better his case, as he bent his mournful gaze on a prospect which
was not, after all, perceptibly improved by its not being Sunday, and could
only feel that, with her, he must seem to himself to be nearer his
wife&mdash;to be touching something she had touched. The old lady wished he
would resign himself more, but she was willing to minister to that thin
illusion, little as she approved of the manner in which he had conducted
himself at the time of the last sharp crisis in the remarkable history of his
relations with Christina. He had behaved like a spoiled child, with a bad
little nature, in a rage; he had been fatally wanting in dignity and wisdom,
and had given the Princess an advantage which she took on the spot and would
keep for ever. He had acted without manly judgment, had put his uncles upon her
(as if she cared for his uncles! though one of them was a powerful prelate),
had been suspicious and jealous on exactly the wrong occasions&mdash;occasions
on which such ideas were a gratuitous injury. He had not been clever enough or
strong enough to make good his valid rights, and had transferred the whole
quarrel to a ground where his wife was far too accomplished a woman not to
obtain the appearance of victory.
</p>

<p>
There was another reflection that Madame Grandoni made, as her interview with
her dejected friend prolonged itself. She could make it the more freely as,
besides being naturally quick and appreciative, she had always, during her
Roman career, in the dear old days (mingled with bitterness as they had been
for her), lived with artists, archæologists, ingenious strangers, people who
abounded in good talk, threw out ideas and played with them. It came over her
that, really, even if things had not come to that particular crisis,
Christina&rsquo;s active, various, ironical mind, with all its audacities and
impatiences, could not have tolerated for long the simple dullness of the
Prince&rsquo;s company. The old lady had said to him, on meeting him, &ldquo;Of
course, what you want to know immediately is whether she has sent you a
message. No, my poor friend, I must tell you the truth. I asked her for one,
but she told me that she had nothing whatever, of any kind, to say to you. She
knew I was coming out to see you. I haven&rsquo;t done so <i>en cachette</i>.
She doesn&rsquo;t like it, but she accepts the necessity for this once, since
you have made the mistake, as she considers it, of approaching her again. We
talked about you, last night, after your note came to me&mdash;for five
minutes; that is, I talked, and Christina was good enough to listen. At the end
she said this (what I shall tell you) with perfect calmness, and the appearance
of being the most reasonable woman in the world. She didn&rsquo;t ask me to
repeat it to you, but I do so because it is the only substitute I can offer you
for a message. &lsquo;I try to occupy my life, my mind, to create interests, in
the odious position in which I find myself; I endeavour to get out of myself,
my small personal disappointments and troubles, by the aid of such poor
faculties as I possess. There are things in the world more interesting, after
all, and I hope to succeed in giving my attention to them. It appears to me not
too much to ask that the Prince, on his side, should make the same
conscientious effort&mdash;and leave me alone!&rsquo; Those were your
wife&rsquo;s remarkable words; they are all I have to give you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After she had given them Madame Grandoni felt a pang of regret; the Prince
turned upon her a face so white, bewildered and wounded. It had seemed to her
that they might form a wholesome admonition, but it was now impressed upon her
that, as coming from his wife, they were cruel, and she herself felt almost
cruel for having repeated them. What they amounted to was an exquisite taunt of
his mediocrity&mdash;a mediocrity which was, after all, not a crime. How could
the Prince occupy himself, what interests could he create, and what faculties,
gracious heaven, did he possess? He was as ignorant as a fish, and as narrow as
his hat-band. His expression became pitiful; it was as if he dimly measured the
insult, felt it more than saw it&mdash;felt that he could not plead incapacity
without putting the Princess largely in the right. He gazed at Madame Grandoni,
his face worked, and for a moment she thought he was going to burst into tears.
But he said nothing&mdash;perhaps because he was afraid of that&mdash;so that
suffering silence, during which she gently laid her hand upon his own, remained
his only answer. He might doubtless do so much he didn&rsquo;t, that when
Christina touched upon this she was unanswerable. The old lady changed the
subject: told him what a curious country England was, in so many ways; offered
information as to their possible movements during the summer and autumn, which,
within a day or two, had become slightly clearer. But at last, abruptly, as if
he had not heard her, he inquired, appealingly, who the young man was who had
come in the day he called, just as he was going.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni hesitated a moment. &ldquo;He was the Princess&rsquo;s
bookbinder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her bookbinder? Do you mean her lover?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Prince, how can you dream she will ever live with you again?&rdquo; the
old lady asked, in reply to this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, then, does she have him in her drawing-room&mdash;announced like an
ambassador, carrying a hat in his hand like mine? Where were his books, his
bindings? I shouldn&rsquo;t say this to her,&rdquo; the Prince added, as if the
declaration justified him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you the other day that she is making studies of the
people&mdash;the lower orders. The young man you saw is a study.&rdquo; Madame
Grandoni could not help laughing out as she gave her explanation this turn; but
her mirth elicited no echo from her interlocutor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have thought that over&mdash;over and over; but the more I think the
less I understand. Would it be your idea that she is quite crazy? I must tell
you I don&rsquo;t care if she is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are all quite crazy, I think,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni; &ldquo;but
the Princess no more than the rest of us. No, she must try everything; at
present she is trying democracy and socialism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Santo Dio!</i>&rdquo; murmured the young man. &ldquo;And what do they
say here when they see her bookbinder?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t seen him, and perhaps they won&rsquo;t. But if they
do, it won&rsquo;t matter, because here everything is forgiven. That a person
should be singular is all they want. A bookbinder will do as well as anything
else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince mused a while, and then he said, &ldquo;How can she bear the dirt,
the bad smell?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about. If you mean the young man
you saw at the house (I may tell you, by the way, that it was only the first
time he had been there, and that the Princess had only seen him once)&mdash;if
you mean the little bookbinder, he isn&rsquo;t dirty, especially what we should
call. The people of that kind, here, are not like our dear Romans. Every one
has a sponge, as big as your head; you can see them in the shops.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are full of gin; their faces are purple,&rdquo; said the Prince;
after which he immediately asked, &ldquo;If she had only seen him once, how
could he have come into her drawing-room that way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady looked at him with a certain severity. &ldquo;Believe, at least,
what <i>I</i> say, my poor friend! Never forget that this was how you spoiled
your affairs most of all&mdash;by treating a person (and such a person!) as if,
as a matter of course, she lied. Christina has many faults, but she
hasn&rsquo;t that one; that&rsquo;s why I can live with her. She will speak the
truth always.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was plainly not agreeable to the Prince to be reminded so sharply of his
greatest mistake, and he flushed a little as Madame Grandoni spoke. But he did
not admit his error, and she doubted whether he even perceived it. At any rate
he remarked rather grandly, like a man who has still a good deal to say for
himself, &ldquo;There are things it is better to conceal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It all depends on whether you are afraid. Christina never is. Oh, I
admit that she is very strange, and when the entertainment of watching her, to
see how she will carry out some of her inspirations, is not stronger than
anything else, I lose all patience with her. When she doesn&rsquo;t fascinate
she can only exasperate. But, as regards yourself, since you are here, and as I
may not see you again for a long time, or perhaps ever (at my
age&mdash;I&rsquo;m a hundred and twenty!), I may as well give you the key of
certain parts of your wife&rsquo;s conduct. It may make it seem to you a little
less fantastic. At the bottom, then, of much that she does is the fact that she
is ashamed of having married you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Less fantastic?&rdquo; the young man repeated, staring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may say that there can be nothing more eccentric than that. But you
know&mdash;or, if not, it isn&rsquo;t for want of her having told
you&mdash;that the Princess considers that in the darkest hour of her life she
sold herself for a title and a fortune. She regards her doing so as such a
horrible piece of frivolity that she can never, for the rest of her days, be
serious enough to make up for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know that she pretends to have been forced. And does she think
she&rsquo;s so serious now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The young man you saw the other day thinks so,&rdquo; said the old
woman, smiling. &ldquo;Sometimes she calls it by another name: she says she has
thrown herself with passion into being &lsquo;modern&rsquo;. That sums up the
greatest number of things that you and your family are not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we are not, thank God! <i>Dio mio, Dio mio!</i>&rdquo; groaned the
Prince. He seemed so exhausted by his reflections that he remained sitting in
his chair after his companion, lifting her crumpled corpulence out of her own,
had proposed that they should walk about a little. She had no ill-nature, but
she had already noticed that whenever she was with Christina&rsquo;s husband
the current of conversation made her, as she phrased it, bump against him.
After administering these small shocks she always steered away, and now, the
Prince having at last got up and offered her his arm, she tried again to talk
with him of things he could consider without bitterness. She asked him about
the health and habits of his uncles, and he replied, for the moment, with the
minuteness which he had been taught that in such a case courtesy demanded; but
by the time that, at her request, they had returned to the gate nearest to
South Street (she wished him to come no farther) he had prepared a question to
which she had not opened the way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who and what, then, is this English captain? About him there is a
great deal said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This English captain?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Godfrey Gerald Cholto&mdash;you see I know a good deal about him,&rdquo;
said the Prince, articulating the English names with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
They had stopped near the gate, on the edge of Park Lane, and a couple of
predatory hansoms dashed at them from opposite quarters. &ldquo;I thought that
was coming, and at bottom it is he that has occupied you most!&rdquo; Madame
Grandoni exclaimed, with a sigh. &ldquo;But in reality he is the last one you
need trouble about; he doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he count?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;except that some people don&rsquo;t, you
know. He doesn&rsquo;t even think he does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not, when she receives him always&mdash;lets him go wherever she
goes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps that is just the reason. When people give her a chance to get
tired of them she takes it rather easily. At any rate, you needn&rsquo;t be any
more jealous of him than you are of me. He&rsquo;s a convenience, a
<i>factotum</i>, but he works without wages.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he, then, in love with her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naturally. He has, however, no hope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, poor gentleman!&rdquo; said the Prince, lugubriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He accepts the situation better than you. He occupies himself&mdash;as
she has strongly recommended him, in my hearing, to do&mdash;with other
women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the brute!&rdquo; the Prince exclaimed. &ldquo;At all events, he
sees her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but she doesn&rsquo;t see him!&rdquo; laughed Madame Grandoni, as
she turned away.

<p>
The pink dressing-gown which Pinnie had engaged to make for Rose Muniment
became, in Lomax Place, a conspicuous object, supplying poor Amanda with a
constant theme for reference to one of the great occasions of her
life&mdash;her visit to Belgrave Square with Lady Aurora, after their meeting
at Rosy&rsquo;s bedside. She described this episode vividly to her companion,
repeating a thousand times that her ladyship&rsquo;s affability was beyond
anything she could have expected. The grandeur of the house in Belgrave Square
figured in her recital as something oppressive and fabulous, tempered though it
had been by shrouds of brown holland and the nudity of staircases and saloons
of which the trappings had been put away. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s so noble when
they&rsquo;re out of town, what can it be when they are all there together and
everything is out?&rdquo; she inquired suggestively; and she permitted herself
to be restrictive only on two points, one of which was the state of Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s gloves and bonnet-strings. If she had not been afraid to appear
to notice the disrepair of these objects, she would have been so happy to offer
to do any little mending. &ldquo;If she would only come to me every week or
two, I would keep up her rank for her,&rdquo; said Pinnie, with visions of a
needle that positively flashed in the disinterested service of the aristocracy.
She added that her ladyship got all dragged out with her long expeditions to
Camberwell; she might be in tatters, for all they could do to help her at the
top of those dreadful stairs, with that strange sick creature (she was too
unnatural) thinking only of her own finery and talking about her complexion. If
she wanted pink, she should have pink; but to Pinnie there was something almost
unholy in it, like decking out a corpse, or the next thing to it. This was the
other element that left Miss Pynsent cold; it could not be other than difficult
for her to enter into the importance her ladyship appeared to attach to those
pushing people. The girl was unfortunate, certainly, stuck up there like a
kitten on a shelf, but in her ladyship&rsquo;s place she would have found some
topic more in keeping, while they walked about under those tremendous gilded
ceilings. Lady Aurora, seeing how she was struck, showed her all over the
house, carrying the lamp herself and telling an old woman who was there&mdash;a
kind of housekeeper, with ribbons in her cap, who would have pushed Pinnie out
if you could push with your eyes&mdash;that they would do very well without
her. If the pink dressing-gown, in its successive stages of development, filled
up the little brown parlour (it was terribly long on the stocks), making such a
pervasive rose-coloured presence as had not been seen there for many a day,
this was evidently because it was associated with Lady Aurora, not because it
was dedicated to her humble friend.
</p>

<p>
One day, when Hyacinth came home from his work, Pinnie announced to him as soon
as he entered the room that her ladyship had been there to look at it&mdash;to
pass judgment before the last touches were conferred. The dressmaker intimated
that in such a case as that her judgment was rather wild, and she had made an
embarrassing suggestion about pockets. Whatever could poor Miss Muniment want
of pockets, and what had she to put in them? But Lady Aurora had evidently
found the garment far beyond anything she expected, and she had been more
affable than ever, and had wanted to know about every one in the Place; not in
a meddling, prying way, either, like some of those upper-class visitors, but
quite as if the poor people were the high ones and she was afraid her curiosity
might be &lsquo;presumptious&rsquo;. It was in the same discreet spirit that
she had invited Amanda to relate her whole history, and had expressed an
interest in the career of her young friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She said you had charming manners,&rdquo; Miss Pynsent hastened to
remark; &ldquo;but, before heaven, Hyacinth Robinson, I never mentioned a scrap
that it could give you pain that any one should talk about.&rdquo; There was an
heroic explicitness in this, on Pinnie&rsquo;s part, for she knew in advance
just how Hyacinth would look at her&mdash;fixedly, silently, hopelessly, as if
she were still capable of tattling horribly (with the idea that her revelations
would increase her importance), and putting forward this hollow theory of her
supreme discretion to cover it up. His eyes seemed to say, &lsquo;How can I
believe you, and yet how can I prove you are lying? I am very helpless, for I
can&rsquo;t prove that without applying to the person to whom your incorrigible
folly has probably led you to brag, to throw out mysterious and tantalising
hints. You know, of course, that I would never condescend to that.&rsquo;
Pinnie suffered, acutely, from this imputation; yet she exposed herself to it
often, because she could never deny herself the pleasure, keener still than her
pain, of letting Hyacinth know that he was appreciated, admired and, for those
&lsquo;charming manners&rsquo; commended by Lady Aurora, even wondered at; and
this kind of interest always appeared to imply a suspicion of his
secret&mdash;something which, when he expressed to himself the sense of it, he
called, resenting it at once and yet finding a certain softness in it, &lsquo;a
beastly <i>attendrissement</i>&rsquo;. When Pinnie went on to say to him that
Lady Aurora appeared to feel a certain surprise at his never yet having come to
Belgrave Square for the famous books, he reflected that he must really wait
upon her without more delay, if he wished to keep up his reputation for
charming manners; and meanwhile he considered much the extreme oddity of this
new phase of his life (it had opened so suddenly, from one day to the other); a
phase in which his society should have become indispensable to ladies of high
rank and the obscurity of his condition only an attraction the more. They were
taking him up then, one after the other, and they were even taking up poor
Pinnie, as a means of getting at him; so that he wondered, with humorous
bitterness, whether it meant that his destiny was really seeking him
out&mdash;that the aristocracy, recognising a mysterious affinity (with that
fineness of <i>flair</i> for which they were remarkable), were coming to him to
save him the trouble of coming to them.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the day (the beginning of an October evening), and Lady Aurora
was at home. Hyacinth had made a mental calculation of the time at which she
would have risen from dinner; the operation of &lsquo;rising from dinner&rsquo;
having always been, in his imagination, for some reason or other, highly
characteristic of the nobility. He was ignorant of the fact that Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s principal meal consisted of a scrap of fish and a cup of tea,
served on a little stand in the dismantled breakfast-parlour. The door was
opened for Hyacinth by the invidious old lady whom Pinnie had described, and
who listened to his inquiry, conducted him through the house, and ushered him
into her ladyship&rsquo;s presence, without the smallest relaxation of a pair
of tightly-closed lips. Hyacinth&rsquo;s hostess was seated in the little
breakfast-parlour, by the light of a couple of candles, immersed apparently in
a collection of tolerably crumpled papers and account-books. She was ciphering,
consulting memoranda, taking notes; she had had her head in her hands, and the
silky entanglement of her tresses resisted the rapid effort she made to smooth
herself down as she saw the little bookbinder come in. The impression of her
fingers remained in little rosy streaks on her pink skin. She exclaimed,
instantly, &ldquo;Oh, you have come about the books&mdash;it&rsquo;s so very
kind of you;&rdquo; and she hurried him off to another room, to which, as she
explained, she had had them brought down for him to choose from. The effect of
this precipitation was to make him suppose at first that she might wish him to
execute his errand as quickly as possible and take himself off; but he
presently perceived that her nervousness, her shyness, were of an order that
would always give false ideas. She wanted him to stay, she wanted to talk with
him, and she had rushed with him at the books in order to gain time and
composure for exercising some subtler art. Hyacinth stayed half an hour, and
became more and more convinced that her ladyship was, as he had ventured to
pronounce her on the occasion of their last meeting, a regular saint. He was
privately a little disappointed in the books, though he selected three or four,
as many as he could carry, and promised to come back for others: they denoted,
on Lady Aurora&rsquo;s part, a limited acquaintance with French literature and
even a certain puerility of taste. There were several volumes of Lamartine and
a set of the spurious memoirs of the Marquise de Créqui; but for the rest the
little library consisted mainly of Marmontel and Madame de Genlis, the <i>Récit
d&rsquo;une Sœur</i> and the tales of M. J. T. de Saint-Germain. There were
certain members of an intensely modern school, advanced and scientific
realists, of whom Hyacinth had heard and on whom he had long desired to put his
hand; but, evidently, none of them had ever stumbled into Lady Aurora&rsquo;s
candid collection, though she did possess a couple of Balzac&rsquo;s novels,
which, by ill-luck, happened to be just those that Hyacinth had read more than
once.
</p>

<p>
There was, nevertheless, something very agreeable to him in the moments he
passed in the big, dim, cool, empty house, where, at intervals, monumental
pieces of furniture&mdash;not crowded and miscellaneous, as he had seen the
appurtenances of the Princess&mdash;loomed and gleamed, and Lady Aurora&rsquo;s
fantastic intonations awakened echoes which gave him a sense of privilege, of
rioting, decently, in the absence of jealous influences. She talked again about
the poor people in the south of London, and about the Muniments in particular;
evidently, the only fault she had to find with these latter was that they were
not poor enough&mdash;not sufficiently exposed to dangers and privations
against which she could step in. Hyacinth liked her for this, even though he
wished she would talk of something else&mdash;he hardly knew what, unless it
was that, like Rose Muniment, he wanted to hear more about Inglefield. He
didn&rsquo;t mind, with the poor, going into questions of poverty&mdash;it even
gave him at times a strange, savage satisfaction&mdash;but he saw that in
discussing them with the rich the interest must inevitably be less; they could
never treat them <i>à fond</i>. Their mistakes and illusions, their thinking
they had got hold of the sensations of the destitute when they hadn&rsquo;t at
all, would always be more or less irritating. It came over Hyacinth that if he
found this want of perspective in Lady Aurora&rsquo;s deep conscientiousness,
it would be a queer enough business when he should come to go into the detail
of such matters with the Princess Casamassima.
</p>

<p>
His present hostess said not a word to him about Pinnie, and he guessed that
she had an instinctive desire to place him on the footing on which people do
not express approbation or surprise at the decency or good-breeding of each
other&rsquo;s relatives. He saw that she would always treat him as a gentleman,
and that even if he should be basely ungrateful she would never call his
attention to the fact that she had done so. He should not have occasion to say
to her, as he had said to the Princess, that she regarded him as a curious
animal; and it gave him immediately that sense, always so delightful to him, of
learning more about life, to perceive there were such different ways (which
implied still a good many more) of being a lady of rank. The manner in which
Lady Aurora appeared to wish to confer with him on the great problems of
pauperism might have implied that he was a benevolent nobleman (of the type of
Lord Shaftesbury), who had endowed many charities and was noted, in
philanthropic schemes, for his practical sense. It was not less present to him
that Pinnie might have tattled, put forward his claims to high consanguinity,
than it had been when the dressmaker herself descanted on her ladyship&rsquo;s
condescensions; but he remembered now that he too had only just escaped being
asinine, when, the other day, he flashed out an allusion to his accursed
origin. At all events, he was much touched by the delicacy with which the
earl&rsquo;s daughter comported herself, simply assuming that he was &lsquo;one
of themselves&rsquo;; and he reflected that if she did know his history (he was
sure he might pass twenty years in her society without discovering whether she
did or not), this shade of courtesy, this natural tact, coexisting even with
extreme awkwardness, illustrated that &lsquo;best breeding&rsquo; which he had
seen alluded to in novels portraying the aristocracy. The only remark on Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s part that savoured in the least of looking down at him from a
height was when she said, cheerfully, encouragingly, &ldquo;I suppose that one
of these days you will be setting up in business for yourself;&rdquo; and this
was not so cruelly patronising that he could not reply, with a smile equally
free from any sort of impertinence, &ldquo;Oh dear, no, I shall never do that.
I should make a great mess of any attempt to carry on a business. I
haven&rsquo;t a particle of that kind of aptitude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora looked a little surprised; then she said, &ldquo;Oh, I see; you
don&rsquo;t like&mdash;you don&rsquo;t like&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated: he saw
she was going to say that he didn&rsquo;t like the idea of going in, to that
extent, for a trade; but he stopped her in time from attributing to him a
sentiment so foolish, and declared that what he meant was simply that the only
faculty he possessed was the faculty of doing his little piece of work,
whatever it was, of liking to do it skillfully and prettily, and of liking
still better to get his money for it when it was done. His conception of
&lsquo;business&rsquo;, or of rising in the world, didn&rsquo;t go beyond that.
&ldquo;Oh yes, I can fancy!&rdquo; her ladyship exclaimed; but she looked at
him a moment with eyes which showed that he puzzled her, that she didn&rsquo;t
quite understand his tone. Before he went away she inquired of him, abruptly
(nothing had led up to it), what he thought of Captain Sholto, whom she had
seen that other evening in Audley Court. Didn&rsquo;t Hyacinth think he was
very odd? Hyacinth confessed to this impression; whereupon Lady Aurora went on
anxiously, eagerly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you consider that&mdash;that&mdash;he is
decidedly vulgar?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can know perfectly&mdash;as well as any one!&rdquo; Then she added,
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a pity they should&mdash;a&mdash;form relations with
any one of that kind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;They&rsquo;, of course, meant Paul Muniment and his sister. &ldquo;With
a person that may be vulgar?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, regarding this solicitude
as exquisite. &ldquo;But think of the people they know&mdash;think of those
they are surrounded with&mdash;think of all Audley Court!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The poor, the unhappy, the labouring classes? Oh, I don&rsquo;t call
<i>them</i> vulgar!&rdquo; cried her ladyship, with radiant eyes. The young
man, lying awake a good deal that night, laughed to himself, on his pillow, not
unkindly, at her fear that he and his friends would be contaminated by the
familiar of a princess. He even wondered whether she would not find the
Princess herself rather vulgar.

<p>
It must not be supposed that Hyacinth&rsquo;s relations with Millicent Henning
had remained unaffected by the remarkable incident she had witnessed at the
theatre. It had made a great impression on the young lady from Pimlico; he
never saw her, for several weeks afterwards, that she had not an immense deal
to say about it; and though it suited her to take the line of being shocked at
the crudity of such proceedings, and of denouncing the Princess for a
bold-faced foreigner, of a kind to which any one who knew anything of what
could go on in London would give a wide berth, it was easy to see that she was
pleased at being brought even into roundabout contact with a person so splendid
and at finding her own discriminating approval of Hyacinth confirmed in such
high quarters. She professed to derive her warrant for her low opinion of the
lady in the box from information given her by Captain Sholto as he sat beside
her&mdash;information of which at different moments she gave a different
version; her anecdotes having nothing in common, at least, save that they were
alike unflattering to the Princess. Hyacinth had many doubts of the
Captain&rsquo;s pouring such confidences into Miss Henning&rsquo;s ear; under
the circumstances it would be such a very unnatural thing for him to do. He
<i>was</i> unnatural&mdash;that was true&mdash;and he might have told
Millicent, who was capable of having plied him with questions, that his
distinguished friend was separated from her husband; but, for the rest, it was
more probable that the girl had given the rein to a certain inventive faculty
which she had already showed him she possessed, when it was a question of
exercising her primitive, half-childish, half-plebeian impulse of destruction,
the instinct of pulling down what was above her, the reckless energy that
would, precisely, make her so effective in revolutionary scenes. Hyacinth (it
has been mentioned) did not consider that Millicent was false, and it struck
him as a proof of positive candour that she should make up absurd, abusive
stories about a person concerning whom she knew nothing at all, save that she
disliked her, and could not hope for esteem, or, indeed, for recognition of any
kind, in return. When people were really false you didn&rsquo;t know where you
stood with them, and on such a point as this Miss Henning could never be
accused of leaving you in obscurity. She said little else about the Captain,
and did not pretend to repeat the remainder of his conversation; taking it with
an air of grand indifference when Hyacinth amused himself with repaying her
strictures on his new acquaintance by drawing a sufficiently derisive portrait
of hers.
</p>

<p>
He took the ground that Sholto&rsquo;s admiration for the high-coloured beauty
in the second balcony had been at the bottom of the whole episode: he had
persuaded the Princess to pretend she was a socialist and should like therefore
to confer with Hyacinth, in order that he might slip into the seat of this too
easily deluded youth. At the same time, it never occurred to our young man to
conceal the fact that the lady in the box had followed him up; he contented
himself with saying that this had been no part of the original plot, but a
simple result&mdash;not unnatural, after all&mdash;of his turning out so much
more fascinating than one might have supposed. He narrated, with sportive
variations, his visit in South Street, and felt that he would never feel the
need, with his childhood&rsquo;s friend, of glossing over that sort of
experience. She might make him a scene of jealousy and welcome&mdash;there were
things that would have much more terror for him than that; her jealousy, with
its violence, its energy, even a certain inconsequent, dare-devil humour that
played through it, entertained him, illustrated the frankness, the passion and
pluck, that he admired her for. He should never be on the footing of sparing
Miss Henning&rsquo;s susceptibilities; how fond she might really be of him he
could not take upon himself to say, but her affection would never take the form
of that sort of delicacy, and their intercourse was plainly foredoomed to be an
exchange of thumps and concussions, of sarcastic shouts and mutual
<i>défis</i>. He liked her, at bottom, strangely, absurdly; but after all it
was only well enough to torment her&mdash;she could bear so much&mdash;not well
enough to spare her. Of there being any justification of her jealousy of the
Princess he never thought; it could not occur to him to weigh against each
other the sentiments he might excite in such opposed bosoms or those that the
spectacle of either emotion might have kindled in his own. He had, no doubt,
his share of fatuity, but he found himself unable to associate, mentally, a
great lady and a shop-girl in a contest for a prize which should present
analogies with his own personality. How could they have anything in
common&mdash;even so small a thing as a desire to possess themselves of
Hyacinth Robinson? A fact that he did not impart to Millicent, and that he
could have no wish to impart to her, was the matter of his pilgrimage to
Belgrave Square. He might be in love with the Princess (how could he qualify,
as yet, the bewildered emotion she had produced in him?), and he certainly
never would conceive a passion for poor Lady Aurora; yet it would have given
him pain much greater than any he felt in the other case, to hear the girl make
free with the ministering angel of Audley Court. The difference was, perhaps,
somehow in that she appeared really not to touch or arrive at the Princess at
all, whereas Lady Aurora was within her range and compass.
</p>

<p>
After paying him that visit at his rooms Hyacinth lost sight of Captain Sholto,
who had not again reappeared at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;, the little
tavern which presented so common and casual a face to the world and yet, in its
unsuspected rear, offered a security as yet unimpugned to machinations going
down to the very bottom of things. Nothing was more natural than that the
Captain should be engaged at this season in the recreations of his class; and
our young man took for granted that if he were not hanging about the Princess,
on that queer footing as to which he himself had a secret hope that he should
some day have more light, he was probably ploughing through northern seas on a
yacht or creeping after stags in the Highlands; our hero&rsquo;s acquaintance
with the light literature of his country being such as to assure him that in
one or other of these occupations people of leisure, during the autumn, were
necessarily immersed. If the Captain were giving his attention to neither, he
must have started for Albania, or at least for Paris. Happy Captain, Hyacinth
reflected, while his imagination followed him through all kinds of vivid exotic
episodes and his restless young feet continued to tread, through the stale,
flat weeks of September and October, the familiar pavements of Soho, Islington
and Pentonville, and the shabby sinuous ways which unite these laborious
districts. He had told the Princess that he sometimes had a holiday at this
period and that there was a chance of his escorting his respectable companion
to the seaside; but as it turned out, at present, the spare cash for such an
excursion was wanting. Hyacinth had indeed, for the moment, an exceptionally
keen sense of the absence of this article, and was forcibly reminded that it
took a good deal of money to cultivate the society of agreeable women. He not
only had not a penny, but he was much in debt, and the explanation of his
pinched feeling was in a vague, half-remorseful, half-resigned reference to the
numerous occasions when he had had to put his hand in his pocket under penalty
of disappointing a young lady whose needs were positive, and especially to a
certain high crisis (as it might prove to be) in his destiny, when it came over
him that one couldn&rsquo;t call on a princess just as one was. So, this year,
he did not ask old Crookenden for the week which some of the other men took
(Eustache Poupin, who had never quitted London since his arrival, launched
himself, precisely that summer, supported by his brave wife, into the British
unknown, on the strength of a return ticket to Worthing); simply because he
shouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. The best way not to spend money,
though it was no doubt not the best in the world to make it, was still to take
one&rsquo;s daily course to the old familiar, shabby shop, where, as the days
shortened and November thickened the air to a livid yellow, the uncovered flame
of the gas, burning often from the morning on, lighted up the ugliness amid
which the hand of practice endeavoured to disengage a little beauty&mdash;the
ugliness of a dingy, belittered interior, of battered, dispapered walls, of
work-tables stained and hacked, of windows opening into a foul, drizzling
street, of the bared arms, the sordid waistcoat-backs, the smeared aprons, the
personal odour, the patient, obstinate, irritating shoulders and vulgar,
narrow, inevitable faces, of his fellow-labourers. Hyacinth&rsquo;s relations
with his comrades would form a chapter by itself, but all that may be said of
the matter here is that the clever little operator from Lomax Place had a kind
of double identity, and that much as he lived in Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s
establishment he lived out of it still more. In this busy, pasty, sticky,
leathery little world, where wages and beer were the main objects of
consideration, he played his part in a manner which caused him to be regarded
as a queer lot, but capable of queerness in the line of good-nature too. He had
not made good his place there without discovering that the British workman,
when animated by the spirit of mirth, has rather a heavy hand, and he tasted of
the practical joke in every degree of violence. During his first year he
dreamed, with secret passion and suppressed tears, of a day of bliss when at
last they would let him alone&mdash;a day which arrived in time, for it is
always an advantage to be clever, if only one is clever enough. Hyacinth was
sufficiently so to have invented a <i>modus vivendi</i> in respect to which M.
Poupin said to him, &ldquo;<i>Enfin vous voilà ferme!</i>&rdquo; (the Frenchman
himself, terribly <i>éprouvé</i> at the beginning, had always bristled with
firmness and opposed to insular grossness a refined dignity), and under the
influence of which the scenery of Soho figured as a daily, dusky
phantasmagoria, relegated to the mechanical, passive part of experience and
giving no hostages to reality, or at least to ambition, save an insufficient
number of shillings on Saturday night and spasmodic reminiscences of delicate
work that might have been more delicate still, as well as of certain
applications of the tool which he flattered himself were unsurpassed, unless by
the supreme Eustache.
</p>

<p>
One evening in November, after discharging himself of a considerable
indebtedness to Pinnie, he had still a sovereign in his pocket&mdash;a
sovereign which seemed to spin there at the opposed solicitation of a dozen
exemplary uses. He had come out for a walk, with a vague intention of pushing
as far as Audley Court; and lurking within this nebulous design, on which the
damp breath of the streets, making objects seem that night particularly dim and
places particularly far, had blown a certain chill, was a sense that it would
be rather nice to take something to Rose Muniment, who delighted in a sixpenny
present and to whom, for some time, he had not rendered any such homage. At
last, after he had wandered a while, hesitating between the pilgrimage to
Camberwell and the possibility of still associating his evening in some way or
other with that of Miss Henning, he reflected that if a sovereign was to be
pulled to pieces it was a simplification to get it changed. He had been
traversing the region of Mayfair, partly with the preoccupation of a short cut
and partly from an instinct of self-defence; if one was in danger of spending
one&rsquo;s money precipitately it was so much gained to plunge into a quarter
in which, at that hour especially, there were no shops for little bookbinders.
Hyacinth&rsquo;s victory, however, was imperfect when it occurred to him to
turn into a public-house in order to convert his gold into convenient silver.
When it was a question of entering these establishments he selected in
preference the most decent; he never knew what unpleasant people he might find
on the other side of the swinging door. Those which glitter, at intervals, amid
the residential gloom of Mayfair partake of the general gentility of the
neighbourhood, so that Hyacinth was not surprised (he had passed into the
compartment marked &lsquo;private bar&rsquo;) to see but a single drinker
leaning against the counter on which, with his request very civilly enunciated,
he put down his sovereign. He was surprised, on the other hand, when, glancing
up again, he became aware that this solitary drinker was Captain Godfrey
Sholto.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, my dear boy, what a remarkable coincidence!&rdquo; the Captain
exclaimed. &ldquo;For once in five years that I come into a place like
this!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come in often myself. I thought you were in
Madagascar,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, because I have not been at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;? Well, I
have been constantly out of town, you know. And then&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see
what I mean?&mdash;I want to be tremendously careful. That&rsquo;s the way to
get on, isn&rsquo;t it? But I dare say you don&rsquo;t believe in my
discretion!&rdquo; Sholto laughed. &ldquo;What shall I do to make you
understand? I say, have a brandy and soda,&rdquo; he continued, as if this
might assist Hyacinth&rsquo;s comprehension. He seemed a trifle flurried, and,
if it were possible to imagine such a thing of so independent and whimsical a
personage, the least bit abashed or uneasy at having been found in such a low
place. It was not any lower, after all, than the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;. He
was dressed on this occasion according to his station, without the pot-hat and
the shabby jacket, and Hyacinth looked at him with a sense that a good tailor
must really add a charm to life. Our hero was struck more than ever before with
his being the type of man whom, as he strolled about, observing people, he had
so often regarded with wonder and envy&mdash;the sort of man of whom one said
to one&rsquo;s self that he was the &lsquo;finest white&rsquo;, feeling that he
had the world in his pocket. Sholto requested the bar-maid to please not dawdle
in preparing the brandy and soda which Hyacinth had thought to ease off the
situation by accepting: this, indeed, was perhaps what the finest white would
naturally do. And when the young man had taken the glass from the counter
Sholto appeared to encourage him not to linger as he drank it, and smiled down
at him very kindly and amusedly, as if the combination of a very small
bookbinder and a big tumbler were sufficiently droll. The Captain took time,
however, to ask Hyacinth how he had spent his autumn and what was the news in
Bloomsbury; he further inquired about those delightful people over the river.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what an impression they made upon me&mdash;that
evening, you know.&rdquo; After this he remarked to Hyacinth, suddenly,
irrelevantly, &ldquo;And so you are just going to stay on for the winter,
quietly?&rdquo; Our young man stared: he wondered what other project any one
could attribute to him; he could not reflect, immediately, that this was the
sort of thing the finest whites said to each other when they met, after their
fashionable dispersals, and that his friend had only been guilty of a momentary
inadvertence. In point of fact the Captain recovered himself: &ldquo;Oh, of
course you have got your work, and that sort of thing;&rdquo; and, as Hyacinth
did not succeed in swallowing at a gulp the contents of his big tumbler, he
asked him presently whether he had heard anything from the Princess. Hyacinth
replied that he could have no news except what the Captain might be good enough
to give him; but he added that he did go to see her just before she left town.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you did go to see her? That&rsquo;s quite right&mdash;quite
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I went because she very kindly wrote to me to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, she wrote to you to come?&rdquo; The Captain fixed Hyacinth for a
moment with his curious colourless eyes. &ldquo;Do you know you are a devilish
privileged mortal?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, I know that.&rdquo; Hyacinth blushed and felt foolish; the
bar-maid, who had heard this odd couple talking about a princess, was staring
at him too, with her elbows on the counter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know there are people who would give their heads that she should
write to them to come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt of it whatever!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed, taking refuge
in a laugh which did not sound as natural as he would have liked, and wondering
whether his interlocutor were not precisely one of these people. In this case
the bar-maid might well stare; for deeply convinced as our young man might be
that he was the son of Lord Frederick Purvis, there was really no end to the
oddity of his being preferred&mdash;and by a princess&mdash;to Captain Sholto.
If anything could have reinforced, at that moment, his sense of this anomaly,
it would have been the indescribably gentlemanly way, implying all sorts of
common initiations, in which his companion went on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, I see you know how to take it! And if you are in
correspondence with her why do you say that you can hear from her only through
me? My dear fellow, I am not in correspondence with her. You might think I
would naturally be, but I am not.&rdquo; He subjoined, as Hyacinth had laughed
again, in a manner that might have passed for ambiguous, &ldquo;So much the
worse for me&mdash;is that what you mean?&rdquo; Hyacinth replied that he
himself had had the honour of hearing from the Princess only once, and he
mentioned that she had told him that her letter-writing came only in fits, when
it was sometimes very profuse: there were months together that she didn&rsquo;t
touch a pen. &ldquo;Oh, I can imagine what she told you!&rdquo; the Captain
exclaimed. &ldquo;Look out for the next fit! She is visiting about. It&rsquo;s
a great thing to be in the same house with her&mdash;an immense comedy.&rdquo;
He remarked that he had heard, now he remembered, that she either had taken, or
was thinking of taking, a house in the country for a few months, and he added
that if Hyacinth didn&rsquo;t propose to finish his brandy and soda they might
as well turn out. Hyacinth&rsquo;s thirst had been very superficial, and as
they turned out the Captain observed, by way of explanation of his having been
found in a public-house (it was the only attempt of this kind he made), that
any friend of his would always know him by his love of curious out-of-the-way
nooks. &ldquo;You must have noticed that,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;my taste
for exploration. If I hadn&rsquo;t explored I never should have known you,
should I? That was rather a nice little girl in there; did you twig her figure?
It&rsquo;s a pity they always have such beastly hands.&rdquo; Hyacinth,
instinctively, had made a motion to go southward, but Sholto, passing a hand
into his arm, led him the other way. The house they had quitted was near a
corner, which they rounded, the Captain pushing forward as if there were some
reason for haste. His haste was checked, however, by an immediate collision
with a young woman who, coming in the opposite direction, turned the angle as
briskly as themselves. At this moment the Captain gave Hyacinth a great jerk,
but not before he had caught a glimpse of the young woman&rsquo;s face&mdash;it
seemed to flash upon him out of the dusk&mdash;and given quick voice to his
surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo, Millicent!&rdquo; This was the simple cry that escaped from his
lips, while the Captain, still going on, inquired, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter? Who&rsquo;s your pretty friend?&rdquo; Hyacinth declined to go on, and
repeated Miss Henning&rsquo;s baptismal name so loudly that the young woman,
who had passed them without looking back, was obliged to stop. Then Hyacinth
saw that he was not mistaken, though Millicent gave no audible response. She
stood looking at him, with her head very high, and he approached her,
disengaging himself from Sholto, who however hung back only an instant before
joining them. Hyacinth&rsquo;s heart had suddenly begun to beat very fast;
there was a sharp shock in the girl&rsquo;s turning up just in that place at
that moment. Yet when she began to laugh, abruptly, with violence, and to ask
him why he was looking at her as if she were a kicking horse, he recognised
that there was nothing so very extraordinary, after all, in a casual meeting
between persons who were such frequenters of the London streets. Millicent had
never concealed the fact that she &lsquo;trotted about&rsquo;, on various
errands, at night; and once, when he had said to her that the less a
respectable young woman took the evening air alone the better for her
respectability, she had asked how respectable he thought she pretended to be,
and had remarked that if he would make her a present of a brougham, or even
call for her three or four times a week in a cab, she would doubtless preserve
more of her social purity. She could turn the tables quickly enough, and she
exclaimed, now, professing, on her own side, great astonishment&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you prowling about here for? You&rsquo;re after no good,
I&rsquo;ll be bound!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Henning; what a jolly meeting!&rdquo; said the
Captain, removing his hat with a humorous flourish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; Millicent returned, as if she did not
immediately place him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where were you going so fast? What are you doing?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth,
who had looked from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I never did see such a manner&mdash;from one that knocks about
like <i>you!</i>&rdquo; cried Miss Henning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see a
friend of mine&mdash;a lady&rsquo;s-maid in Curzon Street. Have you anything to
say to that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell us!&rdquo; Sholto interposed,
after she had spoken (she had not hesitated an instant). &ldquo;I, at least,
disavow the indiscretion. Where may not a charming woman be going when she
trips with a light foot through the gathering dusk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, what are you talking about?&rdquo; the girl inquired, with
dignity, of Hyacinth&rsquo;s companion. She spoke as if with a resentful
suspicion that her foot had not really been perceived to be light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On what errand of mercy, of secret tenderness?&rdquo; the Captain went
on, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Secret yourself!&rdquo; cried Millicent. &ldquo;Do you two always hunt
in couples?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll turn round and go with you as far as your
friend&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Hyacinth said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Millicent replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the Captain added; and the three took their way
together in the direction of Curzon Street. They walked for a few moments in
silence, though the Captain whistled, and then Millicent suddenly turned to
Hyacinth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me where <i>you</i> were going, yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We met in that public-house,&rdquo; the Captain said, &ldquo;and we were
each so ashamed of being found in such a place by the other that we tumbled out
together, without much thinking what we should do with ourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When he&rsquo;s out with me he pretends he can&rsquo;t abide them
houses,&rdquo; Miss Henning declared. &ldquo;I wish I had looked in that one,
to see who was there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s rather nice,&rdquo; the Captain went on. &ldquo;She
told me her name was Georgiana.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I went to get a piece of money changed,&rdquo; Hyacinth said, with a
sense that there was a certain dishonesty in the air; glad that he, at least,
could afford to speak the truth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To get your grandmother&rsquo;s nightcap changed! I recommend you to
keep your money together&mdash;you&rsquo;ve none too much of it!&rdquo;
Millicent exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the reason you are playing me false?&rdquo; Hyacinth flashed
out. He had been thinking, with still intentness, as they walked; at once
nursing and wrestling with a kindled suspicion. He was pale with the idea that
he was being bamboozled; yet he was able to say to himself that one must allow,
in life, for the element of coincidence, and that he might easily put himself
immensely in the wrong by making a groundless charge. It was only later that he
pieced his impressions together, and saw them&mdash;as it
appeared&mdash;justify each other; at present, as soon as he had uttered it, he
was almost ashamed of his quick retort to Millicent&rsquo;s taunt. He ought at
least to have waited to see what Curzon Street would bring forth.
</p>

<p>
The girl broke out upon him immediately, repeating &ldquo;False, false?&rdquo;
with high derision, and wanting to know whether that was the way to knock a
lady about in public. She had stopped short on the edge of a crossing, and she
went on, with a voice so uplifted that he was glad they were in a street that
was rather empty at such an hour: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty one to talk
about falsity, when a woman has only to leer at you out of an opera-box!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything about <i>her</i>,&rdquo; the young man
interposed, trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray why not about &lsquo;her&rsquo;, I should like to know? You
don&rsquo;t pretend she&rsquo;s a decent woman, I suppose?&rdquo;
Millicent&rsquo;s laughter rang through the quiet neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, you know you <i>have</i> been to her,&rdquo; Captain
Sholto remarked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth turned upon him, staring, at once challenged and baffled by his
ambiguous part in an incident it was doubtless possible to magnify but it was
not possible to treat as perfectly simple. &ldquo;Certainly, I have been to the
Princess Casamassima, thanks to you. When you came and begged me, when you
dragged me, do you make it a reproach? Who the devil are you, any way, and what
do you want of me?&rdquo; our hero cried&mdash;his mind flooded in a moment
with everything in the Captain that had puzzled him and eluded him. This
swelling tide obliterated on the spot everything that had entertained and
gratified him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, whatever I am, I am not an ass,&rdquo; this gentleman
replied, with imperturbable good-humour. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reproach you with
anything. I only wanted to put in a word as a peacemaker. My good
friends&mdash;my good friends,&rdquo; and he laid a hand, in his practised way,
on Hyacinth&rsquo;s shoulder, while, with the other pressed to his heart, he
bent on the girl a face of gallantry which had something paternal in it,
&ldquo;I am determined this absurd misunderstanding shall end as lovers&rsquo;
quarrels ought always to end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth withdrew himself from the Captain&rsquo;s touch and said to Millicent,
&ldquo;You are not really jealous of&mdash;of any one. You pretend that, only
to throw dust in my eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To this sally Miss Henning returned him an answer which promised to be lively,
but the Captain swept it away in the profusion of his protests. He pronounced
them a dear delightful, abominable young couple; he declared it was most
interesting to see how, in people of their sort, the passions lay near the
surface; he almost pushed them into each other&rsquo;s arms; and he wound up by
proposing that they should all terminate their little differences by proceeding
together to the Pavilion music-hall, the nearest place of entertainment in that
neighbourhood, leaving the lady&rsquo;s-maid in Curzon Street to dress her
mistress&rsquo;s wig in peace. He has been presented to the reader as an
accomplished man, and it will doubtless be felt that the picture is justified
when I relate that he placed this idea in so attractive a light that his
companions finally entered a hansom with him and rattled toward the haunt of
pleasure, Hyacinth sandwiched, on the edge of the seat, between the others. Two
or three times his ears burned; he felt that if there was an understanding
between them they had now, behind him, a rare opportunity for carrying it out.
If it was at his expense, the whole evening constituted for them, indeed, an
opportunity, and this thought rendered his diversion but scantily absorbing,
though at the Pavilion the Captain engaged a private box and ordered ices to be
brought in. Hyacinth cared so little for his little pink pyramid that he
suffered Millicent to consume it after she had disposed of her own. It was
present to him, however, that if he should make a fool of himself the folly
would be of a very gross kind, and this is why he withheld a question which
rose to his lips repeatedly&mdash;a disposition to inquire of his entertainer
why the mischief he had hurried him so out of the public-house, if he had not
been waiting there, preconcertedly, for Millicent. We know that in
Hyacinth&rsquo;s eyes one of this young lady&rsquo;s compensatory merits had
been that she was not deceitful, and he asked himself if a girl could change,
that way, from one month to the other. This was optimistic, but, all the same,
he reflected, before leaving the Pavilion, that he could see quite well what
Lady Aurora meant by thinking Captain Sholto vulgar.

<h3><a name="chap21"></a>XXI</h3>

<p>
Paul Muniment had fits of silence, while the others were talking; but on this
occasion he had not opened his lips for half an hour. When he talked Hyacinth
listened, almost holding his breath; and when he said nothing Hyacinth watched
him fixedly, listening to the others only through the medium of his candid
countenance. At the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo; Muniment paid very little
attention to his young friend, doing nothing that should cause it to be
perceived they were particular pals; and Hyacinth even thought, at moments,
that he was bored or irritated by the serious manner in which the little
bookbinder could not conceal from the world that he regarded him. He wondered
whether this were a system, a calculated prudence, on Muniment&rsquo;s part, or
only a manifestation of that superior brutality, latent in his composition,
which never had an intention of unkindness but was naturally intolerant of
palaver. There was plenty of palaver at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;; there
were nights when a blast of imbecility seemed to blow over the place, and one
felt ashamed to be associated with so much insistent ignorance and flat-faced
vanity. Then every one, with two or three exceptions, made an ass of himself,
thumping the table and repeating over some inane phrase which appeared for the
hour to constitute the whole furniture of his mind. There were men who kept
saying, &ldquo;Them was my words in the month of February last, and what I say
I stick to&mdash;what I say I stick to;&rdquo; and others who perpetually
inquired of the company, &ldquo;And what the plague am I to do with seventeen
shillings&mdash;with seventeen shillings? What am I to do with them&mdash;will
ye tell me that?&rdquo; an interrogation which, in truth, usually ended by
eliciting a ribald reply. There were still others who remarked, to satiety,
that if it was not done to-day it would have to be done to-morrow, and several
who constantly proclaimed their opinion that the only way was to pull up the
Park rails again&mdash;just to pluck them straight up. A little shoemaker, with
red eyes and a grayish face, whose appearance Hyacinth deplored, scarcely ever
expressed himself but in the same form of words: &ldquo;Well, are we in
earnest, or ain&rsquo;t we in earnest?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing <i>I</i>
want to know.&rdquo; He was terribly in earnest himself, but this was almost
the only way he had of showing it; and he had much in common (though they were
always squabbling) with a large red-faced man, of uncertain attributes and
stertorous breathing, who was understood to know a good deal about dogs, had
fat hands, and wore on his forefinger a big silver ring, containing some
one&rsquo;s hair&mdash;Hyacinth believed it to be that of a terrier, snappish
in life. He had always the same refrain: &ldquo;Well, now, are we just
starving, or ain&rsquo;t we just starving? I should like the &rsquo;vice of the
company on that question.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the tone fell as low as this Paul Muniment held his peace, except that he
whistled a little, leaning back, with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on
the table. Hyacinth often supposed him to be on the point of breaking out and
letting the company know what he thought of them&mdash;he had a perfectly clear
vision of what he must think; but Muniment never compromised his popularity to
that degree: he judged it&mdash;this he once told Hyacinth&mdash;too valuable
an instrument, and cultivated the faculty of patience, which had the advantage
of showing one more and more that one must do one&rsquo;s thinking for
one&rsquo;s self. His popularity, indeed, struck Hyacinth as rather an
uncertain quantity, and the only mistake he had seen a symptom of on his
friend&rsquo;s part was a tendency to overestimate it. Muniment thought many of
their colleagues asinine, but it was Hyacinth&rsquo;s belief that he himself
knew still better how asinine they were; and this inadequate conception
supported, in some degree, on Paul&rsquo;s part, his theory of his
influence&mdash;an influence that would be stronger than any other on the day
he should choose to exert it. Hyacinth only wished that day would come; it
would not be till then, he was sure, that they would all know where they were,
and that the good they were striving for, blindly, obstructedly, in a kind of
eternal dirty intellectual fog, would pass from the stage of crude discussion
and mere sharp, tantalising desirableness into that of irresistible reality.
Muniment was listened to unanimously, when he spoke, and was much talked about,
usually with a knowing, implicit allusiveness, when he was absent; it was
generally admitted that he could see further than most. But it was suspected
that he wanted to see further than was necessary; as one of the most inveterate
frequenters of the club remarked one evening, if a man could see as far as he
could chuck a brick, that was far enough. There was an idea that he had nothing
particular to complain of, personally, or that if he had he didn&rsquo;t
complain of it&mdash;an attitude which perhaps contained the germs of a latent
disaffection. Hyacinth could easily see that he himself was exposed to the same
imputation, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it; it would have been impossible to him
to keep up his character for sincerity by revealing, at the &lsquo;Sun and
Moon&rsquo;, the condition of his wardrobe, or announcing that he had not had a
pennyworth of bacon for six months. There were members of the club who were
apparently always in the enjoyment of involuntary leisure&mdash;narrating the
vainest peregrinations in search of a job, the cruelest rebuffs, the most vivid
anecdotes of the insolence of office. They made Hyacinth uncomfortably
conscious, at times, that if <i>he</i> should be out of work it would be wholly
by his own fault; that he had in his hand a bread-winning tool on which he
might absolutely count. He was also aware, however, that his position in this
little band of malcontents (it was little only if measured by the numbers that
were gathered together on any one occasion; he liked to think it was large in
its latent possibilities, its mysterious ramifications and affiliations) was
peculiar and distinguished; it would be favourable if he had the kind of energy
and assurance that would help him to make use of it. He had an intimate
conviction&mdash;the proof of it was in the air, in the sensible facility of
his footing at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;&mdash;that Eustache Poupin had
taken upon himself to disseminate the anecdote of his origin, of his
mother&rsquo;s disaster; in consequence of which, as the victim of social
infamy, of heinous laws, it was conceded to him that he had a larger account to
settle even than most. He was <i>ab ovo</i> a revolutionist, and that balanced
against his smart neckties, a certain suspicious security that was perceived in
him as to the <i>h</i> (he had had from his earliest years a natural command of
it), and the fact that he possessed the sort of hand on which there is always a
premium&mdash;an accident somehow to be guarded against in a thorough-going
system of equality. He never challenged Poupin on the subject, for he owed the
Frenchman too much to reproach him with any officious step that was meant in
kindness; and moreover his fellow-labourer at old Crookenden&rsquo;s had said
to him, as if to anticipate such an impugnment of his discretion,
&ldquo;Remember, my child, that I am incapable of drawing aside any veil that
you may have preferred to drop over your lacerated personality. Your moral
dignity will always be safe with me. But remember at the same time that among
the disinherited there is a mystic language which dispenses with proofs&mdash;a
freemasonry, a reciprocal divination; they understand each other with half a
word.&rdquo; It was with half a word, then, in Bloomsbury, that Hyacinth had
been understood; but there was a certain delicacy within him that forbade him
to push his advantage, to treat implications of sympathy, none the less
definite for being roundabout, as steps in the ladder of success. He had no
wish to be a leader because his mother had murdered her lover and died in penal
servitude: these circumstances recommended intentness but they also suggested
modesty. When the gathering at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo; was at its best,
and its temper seemed really an earnest of what was the basis of all its
calculations&mdash;that the people was only a sleeping lion, already breathing
shorter and beginning to stretch its limbs&mdash;at these hours, some of them
thrilling enough, Hyacinth waited for the voice that should allot to him the
particular part he was to play. His ambition was to play it with brilliancy, to
offer an example&mdash;an example, even, that might survive him&mdash;of pure
youthful, almost juvenile, consecration. He was conscious of no commission to
give the promises, to assume the responsibilities, of a redeemer, and he had no
envy of the man on whom this burden should rest. Muniment, indeed, might carry
it, and it was the first article of his faith that to help him to carry it the
better he himself was ready for any sacrifice. Then it was&mdash;on these
nights of intenser vibration&mdash;that Hyacinth waited for a sign.

They came oftener, this second winter, for the season was terribly hard; and as
in that lower world one walked with one&rsquo;s ear nearer the ground, the deep
perpetual groan of London misery seemed to swell and swell and form the whole
undertone of life. The filthy air came into the place in the damp coats of
silent men, and hung there till it was brewed to a nauseous warmth, and ugly,
serious faces squared themselves through it, and strong-smelling pipes
contributed their element in a fierce, dogged manner which appeared to say that
it now had to stand for everything&mdash;for bread and meat and beer, for shoes
and blankets and the poor things at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s and the smokeless
chimney at home. Hyacinth&rsquo;s colleagues seemed to him wiser then, and more
permeated with intentions boding ill to the satisfied classes; and though the
note of popularity was still most effectively struck by the man who could
demand oftenest, unpractically, &ldquo;What the plague am I to do with
seventeen shillings?&rdquo; it was brought home to our hero on more than one
occasion that revolution was ripe at last. This was especially the case on the
evening I began by referring to, when Eustache Poupin squeezed in and
announced, as if it were a great piece of news, that in the east of London,
that night, there were forty thousand men out of work. He looked round the
circle with his dilated foreign eye, as he took his place; he seemed to address
the company individually as well as collectively, and to make each man
responsible for hearing him. He owed his position at the &lsquo;Sun and
Moon&rsquo; to the brilliancy with which he represented the political exile,
the magnanimous immaculate citizen wrenched out of bed at dead of night, torn
from his hearthstone, his loved ones and his profession, and hurried across the
frontier with only the coat on his back. Poupin had performed in this character
now for many years, but he had never lost the bloom of the outraged proscript,
and the passionate pictures he had often drawn of the bitterness of exile were
moving even to those who knew with what success he had set up his household
gods in Lisson Grove. He was recognised as suffering everything for his
opinions; and his hearers in Bloomsbury&mdash;who, after all, even in their
most concentrated hours, were very good-natured&mdash;appeared never to have
made the subtle reflection, though they made many others, that there was a want
of tact in his calling upon them to sympathise with him for being one of
themselves. He imposed himself by the eloquence of his assumption that if one
were not in the beautiful France one was nowhere worth speaking of, and ended
by producing an impression that that country had an almost supernatural charm.
Muniment had once said to Hyacinth that he was sure Poupin would be very sorry
if he should be enabled to go home again (as he might, from one week to the
other, the Republic being so indulgent and the amnesty to the Communards
constantly extended), for over there he couldn&rsquo;t be a refugee; and
however this might be he certainly flourished a good deal in London on the
basis of this very fact that he was miserable there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you tell us that, as if it was so very striking? Don&rsquo;t we
know it, and haven&rsquo;t we known it always? But you are right; we behave as
if we knew nothing at all,&rdquo; said Mr Schinkel, the German cabinet-maker,
who had originally introduced Captain Sholto to the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;.
He had a long, unhealthy, benevolent face and greasy hair, and constantly wore
a kind of untidy bandage round his neck, as if for a local ailment. &ldquo;You
remind us&mdash;that is very well; but we shall forget it in half an hour. We
are not serious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardon, pardon;</i> for myself, I do not admit that!&rdquo; Poupin
replied, striking the table with his finger-tips several times, very fast.
&ldquo;If I am not serious, I am nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, you are something,&rdquo; said the German, smoking his monumental
pipe with a contemplative air. &ldquo;We are all something; but I am not sure
it is anything very useful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, things would be worse without us. I&rsquo;d rather be in here, in
<i>this</i> kind of muck, than outside,&rdquo; remarked the fat man who
understood dogs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, it is very pleasant, especially if you have your beer; but
not so pleasant in the east, where fifty thousand people starve. It is a very
unpleasant night,&rdquo; the cabinet-maker went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can it be worse?&rdquo; Eustache Poupin inquired, looking defiantly
at the German, as if to make him responsible for the fat man&rsquo;s
reflection. &ldquo;It is so bad that the imagination recoils, refuses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t care for the imagination!&rdquo; the fat man
declared. &ldquo;We want a compact body, in marching order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you call a compact body?&rdquo; the little gray-faced shoemaker
demanded. &ldquo;I dare say you don&rsquo;t mean your kind of body.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I know what I mean,&rdquo; said the fat man, severely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a grand thing. Perhaps one of these days you&rsquo;ll tell
us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see it for yourself, perhaps, before that day comes,&rdquo;
the gentleman with the silver ring rejoined. &ldquo;Perhaps when you do,
you&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you know, Schinkel says we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the shoemaker,
nodding at the cloud-compelling German.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what no man says!&rdquo; the dog-fancier exclaimed,
gazing straight before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s a bad year&mdash;the blockheads in the
newspapers,&rdquo; Mr Schinkel went on, addressing himself to the company at
large. &ldquo;They say that on purpose&mdash;to convey the impression that
there are such things as good years. I ask the company, has any gentleman
present ever happened to notice that article? The good year is yet to come: it
might begin to-night, if we like; it all depends on our being able to be
serious for a few hours. But that is too much to expect. Mr Muniment is very
serious; he looks as if he were waiting for the signal; but he doesn&rsquo;t
speak&mdash;he never speaks, if I want particularly to hear him. He only
considers, very deeply, I am sure. But it is almost as bad to think without
speaking as to speak without thinking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth always admired the cool, easy way in which Muniment comported himself
when the attention of the public was directed towards him. These manifestations
of curiosity, or of hostility, would have put him out immensely, himself. When
a lot of people, especially the kind of people who were collected at the
&lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;, looked at him, or listened to him, at once, he
always blushed and stammered, feeling that if he couldn&rsquo;t have a million
of spectators (which would have been inspiring) he should prefer to have but
two or three; there was something very embarrassing in twenty.
</p>

<p>
Muniment smiled, for an instant, good-humouredly; then, after a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, looking across at the German, and the German only, as if his remark
were worth noticing, but it didn&rsquo;t matter if the others didn&rsquo;t
understand the reply, he said simply, &ldquo;Hoffendahl&rsquo;s in
London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hoffendahl? <i>Gott in Himmel!</i>&rdquo; the cabinet-maker exclaimed,
taking the pipe out of his mouth. And the two men exchanged a longish glance.
Then Mr Schinkel remarked, &ldquo;That surprises me, <i>sehr</i>. Are you very
sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment continued, for a moment, to look at him. &ldquo;If I keep quiet for
half an hour, with so many valuable suggestions flying all round me, you think
I say too little. Then if I open my head to give out three words, you appear to
think I say too much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, no; on the contrary, I want you to say three more. If you tell me
you have seen him I shall be perfectly satisfied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word, I should hope so! Do you think he&rsquo;s the kind of
party a fellow says he has seen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, when he hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Eustache Poupin, who had been
listening. Every one was listening now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It depends on the fellow he says it to. Not even here?&rdquo; the German
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, here!&rdquo; Paul Muniment exclaimed, in a peculiar tone, and
resumed his muffled whistle again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take care&mdash;take care; you will make me think you
haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Poupin, with his excited expression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want,&rdquo; said Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Nun</i>, I understand,&rdquo; the cabinet-maker remarked, restoring
his pipe to his lips after an interval almost as momentous as the stoppage of a
steamer in mid-ocean.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Ere</i>, &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; repeated the small shoemaker,
indignantly. &ldquo;I dare say it is as good as the place he came from. He
might look in and see what he thinks of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a place you might tell us a little about, now,&rdquo; the
fat man suggested, as if he had been waiting for his chance.
</p>

<p>
Before the shoemaker had time to notice this challenge some one inquired, with
a hoarse petulance, who the blazes they were talking about; and Mr Schinkel
took upon himself to reply that they were talking about a man who hadn&rsquo;t
done what he had done by simply exchanging abstract ideas, however valuable,
with his friends in a respectable pot-house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil has he done, then?&rdquo; some one else demanded; and
Muniment replied, quietly, that he had spent twelve years in a Prussian prison,
and was consequently still an object of a good deal of interest to the police.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you call that very useful, I must say I prefer a
pot-house!&rdquo; cried the shoemaker, appealing to all the company and
looking, as it appeared to Hyacinth, particularly hideous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Doch, doch</i>, it is useful,&rdquo; the German remarked,
philosophically, among his yellow clouds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to say you are not prepared for that, yourself?&rdquo;
Muniment inquired of the shoemaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Prepared for that? I thought we were going to smash that sort of shop
altogether; I thought that was the main part of the job.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They will smash best, those who have been inside,&rdquo; the German
declared; &ldquo;unless, perhaps, they are broken, enervated. But Hoffendahl is
not enervated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, no; no smashing, no smashing,&rdquo; Muniment went on. &ldquo;We
want to keep them standing, and even to build a few more; but the difference
will be that we shall put the correct sort in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I take your idea&mdash;that Griffin is one of the correct sort,&rdquo;
the fat man remarked, indicating the shoemaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought we was going to &rsquo;ave their &rsquo;eads&mdash;all that
bloomin&rsquo; lot!&rdquo; Mr Griffin declared, protesting; while Eustache
Poupin began to enlighten the company as to the great Hoffendahl, one of the
purest martyrs of their cause, a man who had been through everything&mdash;who
had been scarred and branded, tortured, almost flayed, and had never given them
the names they wanted to have. Was it possible they didn&rsquo;t remember that
great combined attempt, early in the sixties, which took place in four
Continental cities at once and which, in spite of every effort to smother it
up&mdash;there had been editors and journalists transported even for hinting at
it&mdash;had done more for the social question than anything before or since?
&ldquo;Through him being served in the manner you describe?&rdquo; some one
asked, with plainness; to which Poupin replied that it was one of those
failures that are more glorious than any success. Muniment said that the affair
had been only a flash in the pan, but that the great value of it was
this&mdash;that whereas some forty persons (and of both sexes) had been engaged
in it, only one had been seized and had suffered. It had been Hoffendahl
himself who was collared. Certainly he had suffered much, he had suffered for
every one; but from that point of view&mdash;that of the economy of
material&mdash;the thing had been a rare success.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know what I call the others? I call &rsquo;em bloody
sneaks!&rdquo; the fat man cried; and Eustache Poupin, turning to Muniment,
expressed the hope that he didn&rsquo;t really approve of such a
solution&mdash;didn&rsquo;t consider that an economy of heroism was an
advantage to any cause. He himself esteemed Hoffendahl&rsquo;s attempt because
it had shaken, more than anything&mdash;except, of course, the
Commune&mdash;had shaken it since the French Revolution, the rotten fabric of
the actual social order, and because that very fact of the impunity, the
invisibility, of the persons concerned in it had given the predatory classes,
had given all Europe, a shudder that had not yet subsided; but for his part, he
must regret that some of the associates of the devoted victim had not come
forward and insisted on sharing with him his tortures and his captivity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;aurait été d&rsquo;un bel exemple!</i>&rdquo; said the
Frenchman, with an impressive moderation of statement which made even those who
could not understand him see that he was saying something fine; while the
cabinet-maker remarked that in Hoffendahl&rsquo;s place any of them would have
stood out just the same. He didn&rsquo;t care if they set it down to self-love
(Mr Schinkel called it &lsquo;loaf&rsquo;), but he might say that he himself
would have done so if he had been trusted and had been bagged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to have it all drawn up clear first; then I&rsquo;ll go
in,&rdquo; said the fat man, who seemed to think it was expected of him to be
reassuring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, who the dickens is to draw it up, eh? That&rsquo;s what we happen
to be talking about,&rdquo; returned his antagonist the shoemaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fine example, old man? Is that your idea of a fine example?&rdquo;
Muniment, with his amused face, asked of Poupin. &ldquo;A fine example of
asininity! Are there capable people, in such plenty, about the place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Capable of greatness of soul, I grant you not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your greatness of soul is usually greatness of blundering. A man&rsquo;s
foremost duty is not to get collared. If you want to show you&rsquo;re capable,
that&rsquo;s the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Hyacinth suddenly felt himself moved to speak. &ldquo;But some one must
be caught, always, must he not? Hasn&rsquo;t some one always been?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say you&rsquo;ll be, if you like it!&rdquo; Muniment replied,
without looking at him. &ldquo;If they succeed in potting you, do as Hoffendahl
did, and do it as a matter of course; but if they don&rsquo;t, make it your
supreme duty, make it your religion, to lie close and keep yourself for another
go. The world is full of unclean beasts whom I shall be glad to see shovelled
away by the thousand; but when it&rsquo;s a question of honest men and men of
courage, I protest against the idea that two should be sacrificed where one
will serve.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Trop d&rsquo;arithmétique&mdash;trop d&rsquo;arithmétique!</i> That
is fearfully English!&rdquo; Poupin cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt; what else should it be? You shall never share my
fate, if I have a fate and I can prevent it!&rdquo; said Muniment, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Eustache Poupin stared at him and his merriment, as if he thought the English
frivolous as well as calculating; then he rejoined, &ldquo;If I suffer, I trust
it may be for suffering humanity, but I trust it may also be for France.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I hope you ain&rsquo;t going to suffer any more for France,&rdquo;
said Mr Griffin. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it done that insatiable old country of
yours some good, by this time, all you&rsquo;ve had to put up with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I want to know what Hoffendahl has come over for; it&rsquo;s very
kind of him, I&rsquo;m sure. What is he going to do for
<i>us?</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> want to know,&rdquo; remarked in a
loud, argumentative tone a personage at the end of the table most distant from
Muniment&rsquo;s place. His name was Delancey, and he gave himself out as
holding a position in a manufactory of soda-water; but Hyacinth had a secret
belief that he was really a hairdresser&mdash;a belief connected with a high,
lustrous curl, or crest, which he wore on the summit of his large head, and the
manner in which he thrust over his ear, as if it were a barber&rsquo;s comb,
the pencil with which he was careful to take notes of the discussions carried
on at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;. His opinions were distinct and frequently
expressed; he had a watery (Muniment had once called it a soda-watery) eye, and
a personal aversion to a lord. He desired to change everything except religion,
of which he approved.
</p>

<p>
Muniment answered that he was unable to say, as yet, what the German
revolutionist had come to England for, but that he hoped to be able to give
some information on the matter the next time they should meet. It was very
certain Hoffendahl hadn&rsquo;t come for nothing, and he would undertake to
declare that they would all feel, within a short time, that he had given a lift
to the cause they were interested in. He had had a great experience, and they
might very well find it useful to consult. If there was a way for them, then
and there, he was sure to know the way. &ldquo;I quite agree with the majority
of you&mdash;as I take it to be,&rdquo; Muniment went on, with his fresh,
cheerful, reasonable manner&mdash;&ldquo;I quite agree with you that the time
has come to settle upon it and to follow it. I quite agree with you that the
actual state of things is&rdquo;&mdash;he paused a moment, and then went on in
the same pleasant tone&mdash;&ldquo;is hellish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These remarks were received with a differing demonstration: some of the company
declaring that if the Dutchman cared to come round and smoke a pipe they would
be glad to see him&mdash;perhaps he&rsquo;d show where the thumb-screws had
been put on; others being strongly of the opinion that they didn&rsquo;t want
any more advice&mdash;they had already had advice enough to turn a
donkey&rsquo;s stomach. What they wanted was to put forth their might without
any more palaver; to do something, or for some one; to go out somewhere and
smash something, on the spot&mdash;why not?&mdash;that very night. While they
sat there and talked, there were about half a million of people in London that
didn&rsquo;t know where the h&mdash;&mdash; the morrow&rsquo;s meal was to come
from; what they wanted to do, unless they were just a collection of
pettifogging old women, was to show them where to get it, to take it to them
with heaped-up hands. Hyacinth listened, with a divided attention, to
interlaced iterations, while the talk blew hot and cold; there was a genuine
emotion, to-night, in the rear of the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;, and he felt
the contagion of excited purpose. But he was following a train of his own; he
was wondering what Muniment had in reserve (for he was sure he was only playing
with the company), and his imagination, quickened by the sense of impending
relations with the heroic Hoffendahl and the discussion as to the alternative
duty of escaping or of facing one&rsquo;s fate, had launched itself into
possible perils&mdash;into the idea of how he might, in a given case, settle
for himself that question of paying for the lot. The loud, contradictory, vain,
unpractical babble went on about him, but he was definitely conscious only that
the project of breaking into the bakers&rsquo; shops was well before the
assembly and was receiving a vigorous treatment, and that there was likewise a
good deal of reference to the butchers and grocers, and even to the
fishmongers. He was in a state of inward exaltation; he was seized by an
intense desire to stand face to face with the sublime Hoffendahl, to hear his
voice, to touch his mutilated hand. He was ready for anything: he knew that he
himself was safe to breakfast and dine, poorly but sufficiently, and that his
colleagues were perhaps even more crude and clumsy than usual; but a breath of
popular passion had passed over him, and he seemed to see, immensely magnified,
the monstrosity of the great ulcers and sores of London&mdash;the sick, eternal
misery crying, in the darkness, in vain, confronted with granaries and
treasure-houses and places of delight, where shameless satiety kept guard. In
such a mood as this Hyacinth felt that there was no need to consider, to
reason: the facts themselves were as imperative as the cry of the drowning; for
while pedantry gained time didn&rsquo;t starvation gain it too? He knew that
Muniment disapproved of delay, that he held the day had come for a forcible
rectification of horrible inequalities. In the last conversation they had had
together his chemical friend had given him a more definite warrant than he had
ever done before for numbering him in the party of immediate action, though
indeed he remarked on this occasion, once more, that that particular formula
which the little bookbinder appeared to have taken such a fancy to was mere
gibberish. He hated that sort of pretentious label; it was fit only for
politicians and amateurs. None the less he had been as plain as possible on the
point that their game must be now to frighten society, and frighten it
effectually; to make it believe that the swindled classes were at last fairly
in league&mdash;had really grasped the idea that, closely combined, they would
be irresistible. They were not in league, and they hadn&rsquo;t in their
totality grasped any idea at all&mdash;Muniment was not slow to make that
equally plain. All the same, society was scareable, and every great scare was a
gain for the people. If Hyacinth had needed warrant to-night for a faith that
transcended logic, he would have found it in his recollection of this quiet
profession; but his friend&rsquo;s words came back to him mainly to make him
wonder what that friend had in his head just now. He took no part in the
violence of the talk; he had called Schinkel to come round and sit beside him,
and the two appeared to confer together in comfortable absorption, while the
brown atmosphere grew denser, the passing to and fro of fire-brands more
lively, and the flush of faces more portentous. What Hyacinth would have liked
to know most of all was why Muniment had not mentioned to him, first, that
Hoffendahl was in London, and that he had seen him; for he <i>had</i> seen him,
though he had dodged Schinkel&rsquo;s question&mdash;of that Hyacinth instantly
felt sure. He would ask for more information later; and meanwhile he wished,
without resentment, but with a certain helpless, patient longing, that Muniment
would treat him with a little more confidence. If there were a secret in regard
to Hoffendahl (and there evidently was: Muniment, quite rightly, though he had
dropped the announcement of his arrival, for a certain effect, had no notion of
sharing the rest of what he knew with that raw roomful), if there was something
to be silent and devoted about, Hyacinth ardently hoped that to him a chance
would be given to show how he could practise this superiority. He felt hot and
nervous; he got up suddenly, and, through the dark, tortuous, greasy passage
which communicated with the outer world, he went forth into the street. The air
was foul and sleety, but it refreshed him, and he stood in front of the
public-house and smoked another pipe. Bedraggled figures passed in and out, and
a damp, tattered, wretched man, with a spongy, purple face, who had been thrust
suddenly across the threshold, stood and whimpered in the brutal blaze of the
row of lamps. The puddles glittered roundabout, and the silent vista of the
street, bordered with low black houses, stretched away, in the wintry drizzle,
to right and left, losing itself in the huge tragic city, where unmeasured
misery lurked beneath the dirty night, ominously, monstrously, still, only
howling, in its pain, in the heated human cockpit behind him. Ah, what could he
do? What opportunity would rise? The blundering, divided counsels he had been
listening to only made the helplessness of every one concerned more abject. If
he had a definite wish while he stood there it was that that exalted, deluded
company should pour itself forth, with Muniment at its head, and surge through
the sleeping city, gathering the myriad miserable out of their slums and
burrows, and roll into the selfish squares, and lift a tremendous hungry voice,
and awaken the gorged indifferent to a terror that would bring them down.
Hyacinth lingered a quarter of an hour, but this grand spectacle gave no sign
of coming off, and he finally returned to the noisy club-room, in a state of
tormented wonder as to what better idea than this very bad one (which seemed to
our young man to have at the least the merit that it <i>was</i> an idea)
Muniment could be revolving in that too-comprehensive brain of his.
</p>

<p>
As he re-entered the place he saw that the meeting was breaking up in disorder,
or at all events in confusion, and that, certainly, no organised attempt at the
rescue of the proletariat would take place that night. All the men were on
their feet and were turning away, amid a shuffling of benches and chairs, a
hunching of shaggy shoulders, a frugal lowering of superfluous gas, and a
varied vivacity of disgust and resignation. The moment after Hyacinth came in,
Mr Delancey, the supposititious hairdresser, jumped upon a chair at the far end
of the room, and shrieked out an accusation which made every one stop and stare
at him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I want you all to know what strikes me, before we part company.
There isn&rsquo;t a man in the blessed lot that isn&rsquo;t afraid of his
bloody skin&mdash;afraid, afraid, afraid! I&rsquo;ll go anywhere with any one,
but there isn&rsquo;t another, by G&mdash;&mdash; by what I can make out! There
isn&rsquo;t a mother&rsquo;s son of you that&rsquo;ll risk his precious
bones!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This little oration affected Hyacinth like a quick blow in the face; it seemed
to leap at him personally, as if a three-legged stool, or some hideous
hob-nailed boot, had been shied at him. The room surged round, heaving up and
down, while he was conscious of a loud explosion of laughter and scorn; of
cries of &ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo; of some clear word of Muniment&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;I say, Delancey, just step down;&rdquo; of Eustache Poupin shouting out,
&ldquo;<i>Vous insultez le peuple&mdash;vous insultez le peuple!</i>&rdquo; of
other retorts, not remarkable for refinement. The next moment Hyacinth found
that he had sprung up on a chair, opposite to the barber, and that at the sight
of so rare a phenomenon the commotion had suddenly checked itself. It was the
first time he had asked the ear of the company, and it was given on the spot.
He was sure he looked very white, and it was even possible they could see him
tremble. He could only hope that this didn&rsquo;t make him ridiculous when he
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right of him to say that. There are
others, besides him. At all events, I want to speak for myself: it may do some
good; I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m not afraid; I&rsquo;m very sure
I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m ready to do anything that will do any good; anything,
anything&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care a rap. In such a cause I should like the idea
of danger. I don&rsquo;t consider my bones precious in the least, compared with
some other things. If one is sure one isn&rsquo;t afraid, and one is accused,
why shouldn&rsquo;t one say so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It appeared to Hyacinth that he was talking a long time, and when it was over
he scarcely knew what happened. He felt himself, in a moment, down almost under
the feet of the other men; stamped upon with intentions of applause, of
familiarity; laughed over and jeered over, hustled and poked in the ribs. He
felt himself also pressed to the bosom of Eustache Poupin, who apparently was
sobbing, while he heard some say, &ldquo;Did ye hear the little beggar, as bold
as a lion?&rdquo; A trial of personal prowess between him and Mr Delancey was
proposed, but somehow it didn&rsquo;t take place, and at the end of five
minutes the club-room emptied itself, not, evidently, to be reconstituted,
outside, in a revolutionary procession. Paul Muniment had taken hold of
Hyacinth, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you to stay, you little
desperado. I&rsquo;ll be blowed if I ever expected to see <i>you</i> on the
stump!&rdquo; Muniment remained, and M. Poupin and Mr Schinkel lingered in
their overcoats, beneath a dim, surviving gasburner, in the unventilated medium
in which, at each renewed gathering, the Bloomsbury club seemed to recognise
itself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word, I believe you&rsquo;re game,&rdquo; said Muniment, looking
down at him with a serious face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you think it&rsquo;s swagger, &lsquo;self-loaf&rsquo;, as
Schinkel says. But it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then Hyacinth asked, &ldquo;In
God&rsquo;s name, why don&rsquo;t we do something?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my child, to whom do you say it?&rdquo; Eustache Poupin exclaimed,
folding his arms, despairingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whom do you mean by &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the lot of us. There are plenty of them ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ready for what? There is nothing to be done here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stared. &ldquo;Then why the deuce do you come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say I shan&rsquo;t come much more. This is a place you have
always overestimated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if I have overestimated you,&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured, gazing
at his friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;he&rsquo;s going to introduce us to
Hoffendahl!&rdquo; Schinkel exclaimed, putting away his pipe in a receptacle
almost as large as a fiddle-case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Should you like to see the genuine article, Robinson?&rdquo; Muniment
asked, with the same unusual absence of jocosity in his tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The genuine article?&rdquo; Hyacinth looked from one of his companions
to the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have never seen it yet&mdash;though you think you have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why haven&rsquo;t you shown it to me before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I had never seen you on the stump.&rdquo; This time Muniment
smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bother the stump! I was trusting you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly so. That gave me time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come unless your mind is made up, <i>mon petit</i>,&rdquo;
said Poupin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going now&mdash;to see Hoffendahl?&rdquo; Hyacinth cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout it all over the place. He wants a genteel little
customer like you,&rdquo; Muniment went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it true? Are we all going?&rdquo; Hyacinth demanded eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, these two are in it; they are not very artful, but they are
safe,&rdquo; said Muniment, looking at Poupin and Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> the genuine article, Muniment?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth,
catching this look.
</p>

<p>
Muniment dropped his eyes on him; then he said, &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re the
boy he wants. It&rsquo;s at the other end of London; we must have a
growler.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be calm, my child; <i>me voici!</i>&rdquo; And Eustache Poupin led
Hyacinth out.
</p>

<p>
They all walked away from the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;, and it was not for
some five minutes that they encountered the four-wheeled cab which deepened so
the solemnity of their expedition. After they were seated in it, Hyacinth
learned that Hoffendahl was in London but for three days, was liable to hurry
away on the morrow, and was accustomed to receive visits at all kinds of queer
hours. It was getting to be midnight; the drive seemed interminable, to
Hyacinth&rsquo;s impatience and curiosity. He sat next to Muniment, who passed
his arm round him, as if by way of tacit expression of indebtedness. They all
ended by sitting silent, as the cab jogged along murky miles, and by the time
it stopped Hyacinth had wholly lost, in the drizzling gloom, a sense of their
whereabouts.

<p>
Hyacinth got up early&mdash;an operation attended with very little effort, as
he had scarcely closed his eyes all night. What he saw from his window made him
dress as rapidly as a young man could do who desired more than ever that his
appearance should not give strange ideas about him: an old garden, with
parterres in curious figures, and little intervals of lawn which appeared to
our hero&rsquo;s cockney vision fantastically green. At one end of the garden
was a parapet of mossy brick, which looked down on the other side into a canal,
or moat, or quaint old pond; and from the same standpoint there was also a view
of a considerable part of the main body of the house (Hyacinth&rsquo;s room
appeared to be in a wing commanding the extensive, irregular back), which was
richly gray wherever it was not green with ivy and other dense creepers, and
everywhere infinitely like a picture, with a high-piled, ancient, russet roof,
broken by huge chimneys and queer peep-holes and all manner of odd gables and
windows on different lines and antique patches and protrusions, and a
particularly fascinating architectural excrescence in which a wonderful
clock-face was lodged&mdash;a clock-face covered with gilding and blazonry but
showing many traces of the years and the weather. Hyacinth had never in his
life been in the country&mdash;the real country, as he called it, the country
which was not the mere ravelled fringe of London&mdash;and there entered
through his open casement the breath of a world enchantingly new and, after his
recent feverish hours, inexpressibly refreshing to him; a sense of sweet, sunny
air and mingled odours, all strangely pure and agreeable, and a kind of musical
silence, the greater part of which seemed to consist of the voices of birds.
There were tall, quiet trees near by, and afar off, and everywhere; and the
group of objects which greeted Hyacinth&rsquo;s eyes evidently formed only a
corner of larger spaces and a more complicated scene. There was a world to be
revealed to him: it lay waiting, with the dew upon it, under his windows, and
he must go down and take his first steps in it.
</p>

<p>
The night before, at ten o&rsquo;clock, when he arrived, he had only got the
impression of a mile-long stretch of park, after turning in at a gate; of the
cracking of gravel under the wheels of the fly; and of the glow of several
windows, suggesting in-door cheer, in a façade that lifted a variety of vague
pinnacles into the starlight. It was much of a relief to him then to be
informed that the Princess, in consideration of the lateness of the hour,
begged to be excused till the morrow; the delay would give him time to recover
his balance and look about him. This latter opportunity was offered him first
as he sat at supper in a vast dining-room, with the butler, whose acquaintance
he had made in South Street, behind his chair. He had not exactly wondered how
he should be treated: there was too much vagueness in his conception of the way
in which, at a country-house, insidious distinctions might be made and shades
of importance illustrated; but it was plain that the best had been ordered for
him. He was, at all events, abundantly content with his reception and more and
more excited by it. The repast was delicate (though his other senses were so
awake that hunger dropped out and he ate, as it were, without eating), and the
grave mechanical servant filled his glass with a liquor that reminded him of
some lines in Keats&mdash;in the <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i>. He wondered
whether he should hear a nightingale at Medley (he knew nothing about the
seasons of this vocalist), and also whether the butler would attempt to talk to
him, had ideas about him, knew or suspected who he was and what; which, after
all, there was no reason for his doing, unless it might be the poverty of the
luggage that had been transported from Lomax Place. Mr Withers, however (it was
in this manner that Hyacinth heard him addressed by the cabman who conveyed the
visitor from the station), gave no further symptom of sociability than to ask
him at what time he would be called in the morning; to which our young man
replied that he preferred not to be called at all&mdash;he would get up by
himself. The butler rejoined, &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; while Hyacinth
thought it probable that he puzzled him a good deal, and even considered the
question of giving him a glimpse of his identity, lest it should be revealed,
later, in a manner less graceful. The object of this anticipatory step, in
Hyacinth&rsquo;s mind, was that he should not be oppressed and embarrassed with
attentions to which he was unused; but the idea came to nothing, for the simple
reason that before he spoke he found that he already <i>was</i> inured to being
waited upon. His impulse to deprecate attentions departed, and he became
conscious that there were none he should care to miss, or was not quite
prepared for. He knew he probably thanked Mr Withers too much, but he
couldn&rsquo;t help this&mdash;it was an irrepressible tendency and an error he
should doubtless always commit.
</p>

<p>
He lay in a bed constituted in a manner so perfect to insure rest that it was
probably responsible in some degree for his restlessness, and in a large, high
room, where long dressing-glasses emitted ghostly glances even after the light
was extinguished. Suspended on the walls were many prints, mezzotints and old
engravings, which Hyacinth supposed, possibly without reason, to be fine and
rare. He got up several times in the night, lighted his candle and walked about
looking at them. He looked at himself in one of the long glasses, and in a
place where everything was on such a scale it seemed to him more than ever that
Mademoiselle Vivier&rsquo;s son was a tiny particle. As he came downstairs he
encountered housemaids, with dusters and brooms, or perceived them, through
open doors, on their knees before fireplaces; and it was his belief that they
regarded him more boldly than if he had been a guest of the usual kind. Such a
reflection as that, however, ceased to trouble him after he had passed out of
doors and begun to roam through the park, into which he let himself loose at
first, and then, in narrowing circles, through the nearer grounds. He rambled
for an hour, in a state of breathless ecstasy; brushing the dew from the deep
fern and bracken and the rich borders of the garden, tasting the fragrant air,
and stopping everywhere, in murmuring rapture, at the touch of some exquisite
impression. His whole walk was peopled with recognitions; he had been dreaming
all his life of just such a place and such objects, such a morning and such a
chance. It was the last of April, and everything was fresh and vivid; the great
trees, in the early air, were a blur of tender shoots. Round the admirable
house he revolved repeatedly; catching every point and tone, feasting on its
expression, and wondering whether the Princess would observe his proceedings
from the window, and whether, if she did, they would be offensive to her. The
house was not hers, but only hired for three months, and it could flatter no
princely pride that he should be struck with it. There was something in the way
the gray walls rose from the green lawn that brought tears to his eyes; the
spectacle of long duration unassociated with some sordid infirmity or poverty
was new to him; he had lived with people among whom old age meant, for the most
part, a grudged and degraded survival. In the majestic preservation of Medley
there was a kind of serenity of success, an accumulation of dignity and honour.
</p>

<p>
A footman sought him out, in the garden, to tell him that breakfast was ready.
He had never thought of breakfast, and as he walked back to the house, attended
by the inscrutable flunkey, this offer appeared a free, extravagant gift,
unexpected and romantic. He found he was to breakfast alone, and he asked no
questions; but when he had finished the butler came in and informed him that
the Princess would see him after luncheon, but that in the meanwhile she wished
him to understand that the library was entirely at his service. &lsquo;After
luncheon&rsquo;&mdash;that threw the hour he had come for very far into the
future, and it caused him some confusion of mind that the Princess should think
it worth while to invite him to stay at her house from Saturday evening to
Monday morning if it had been her purpose that so much of his visit should
elapse without their meeting. But he felt neither slighted nor impatient; the
impressions that had already crowded upon him were in themselves a sufficient
reward, and what could one do better, precisely, in such a house as that, than
wait for a princess? The butler showed him the way to the library, and left him
planted in the middle of it, staring at the treasures that he instantly
perceived it contained. It was an old brown room, of great extent&mdash;even
the ceiling was brown, though there were figures in it dimly gilt&mdash;where
row upon row of finely-lettered backs returned his discriminating professional
gaze. A fire of logs crackled in a great chimney, and there were alcoves with
deep window-seats, and arm-chairs such as he had never seen, luxurious,
leather-covered, with an adjustment for holding one&rsquo;s volume; and a vast
writing-table, before one of the windows, furnished with a perfect magazine of
paper and pens, inkstands and blotters, seals, stamps, candlesticks, reels of
twine, paper-weights, book-knives. Hyacinth had never imagined so many aids to
correspondence, and before he turned away he had written a note to Millicent,
in a hand even more beautiful than usual&mdash;his penmanship was very minute,
but at the same time wonderfully free and fair&mdash;largely for the pleasure
of seeing &lsquo;Medley Hall&rsquo; stamped in crimson, heraldic-looking
characters at the top of his paper. In the course of an hour he had ravaged the
collection, taken down almost every book, wishing he could keep it a week, and
put it back quickly, as his eye caught the next, which appeared even more
desirable. He discovered many rare bindings, and gathered several ideas from an
inspection of them&mdash;ideas which he felt himself perfectly capable of
reproducing. Altogether, his vision of true happiness, at that moment, was
that, for a month or two, he should be locked into the library at Medley. He
forgot the outer world, and the morning waned&mdash;the beautiful vernal
Sunday&mdash;while he lingered there.
</p>

<p>
He was on the top of a ladder when he heard a voice remark, &ldquo;I am afraid
they are very dusty; in this house, you know, it is the dust of
centuries;&rdquo; and, looking down, he saw Madame Grandoni stationed in the
middle of the room. He instantly prepared to descend, to make her his
salutation, when she exclaimed, &ldquo;Stay, stay, if you are not giddy; we can
talk from here! I only came in to show you we <i>are</i> in the house, and to
tell you to keep up your patience. The Princess will probably see you in a few
hours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really hope so,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, from his perch, rather dismayed
at the &lsquo;probably&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Natürlich</i>,&rdquo; the old lady rejoined; &ldquo;but people have
come, sometimes, and gone away without seeing her. It all depends upon her
mood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean even when she has sent for them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, who can tell whether she has sent for them or not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she sent for me, you know,&rdquo; Hyacinth declared, staring
down&mdash;struck with the odd effect of Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s wig in that
bird&rsquo;s-eye view.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, she sent for you, poor young man!&rdquo; The old lady looked up
at him with a smile, and they remained a moment exchanging a silent scrutiny.
Then she added, &ldquo;Captain Sholto has come, like that, more than once; and
he has gone away no better off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Sholto?&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very true, if we talk at this distance I must shut the door.&rdquo; She
took her way back to it (she had left it open) and pushed it to; then advanced
into the room again, with her superannuated, shuffling step, walking as if her
shoes were too big for her. Hyacinth meanwhile descended the ladder.
&ldquo;<i>Ecco!</i> She&rsquo;s a <i>capricciosa</i>,&rdquo; said the old lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you speak of her,&rdquo; Hyacinth remarked,
gravely. &ldquo;You seem to be her friend, yet you say things that are not
favourable to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear young man, I say much worse to her about herself than I should ever
say to you. I am rude, oh yes&mdash;even to you, to whom, no doubt, I ought to
be particularly kind. But I am not false. It is not our German nature. You will
hear me some day. I <i>am</i> the friend of the Princess; it would be well
enough if she never had a worse one! But I should like to be yours,
too&mdash;what will you have? Perhaps it is of no use. At any rate, here you
are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, here I am, decidedly!&rdquo; Hyacinth laughed, uneasily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how long shall you stay? Excuse me if I ask that; it is part of my
rudeness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall stay till to-morrow morning. I must be at my work by
noon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That will do very well. Don&rsquo;t you remember, the other time, how I
told you to remain faithful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was very good advice. But I think you exaggerate my danger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni; &ldquo;though now that
I look at you well I doubt it a little. I see you are one of those types that
ladies like. I can be sure of that, because I like you myself. At my
age&mdash;a hundred and twenty&mdash;can I not say that? If the Princess were
to do so, it would be different; remember that&mdash;that any flattery she may
ever offer you will be on her lips much less discreet. But perhaps she will
never have the chance; you may never come again. There are people who have come
only once. <i>Vedremo bene</i>. I must tell you that I am not in the least
against a young man taking a holiday, a little quiet recreation, once in a
while,&rdquo; Madame Grandoni continued, in her disconnected, discursive,
confidential way. &ldquo;In Rome they take it every five days; that is, no
doubt, too often. In Germany, less often. In this country, I cannot understand
whether it is an increase of effort: the English Sunday is so difficult! This
one will, however, in any case, have been beautiful for you. Be happy, make
yourself comfortable; but go home to-morrow!&rdquo; And with this injunction
Madame Grandoni took her way again to the door, while Hyacinth went to open it
for her. &ldquo;I can say that, because it is not my house. I am only here like
you. And sometimes I think I also shall go to-morrow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I imagine you have not, like me, your living to get, every day. That is
reason enough for me,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
She paused in the doorway, with her expressive, ugly, kindly little eyes on his
face. &ldquo;I believe I am nearly as poor as you. And I have not, like you,
the appearance of nobility. Yet I am noble,&rdquo; said the old lady, shaking
her wig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I am not!&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is better not to be lifted up high, like our friend. It does not give
happiness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to one&rsquo;s self, possibly; but to others!&rdquo; From where they
stood, Hyacinth looked out into the great panelled and decorated hall, lighted
from above and roofed with a far-away dim fresco, and the reflection of this
grandeur came into his appreciative eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you admire everything here very much&mdash;do you receive great
pleasure?&rdquo; asked Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, so much&mdash;so much!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She considered him a moment longer. &ldquo;<i>Poverino!</i>&rdquo; she
murmured, as she turned away.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours later the Princess sent for Hyacinth, and he was conducted
upstairs, through corridors carpeted with crimson and hung with pictures, and
ushered into a kind of bright drawing-room, which he afterwards learned that
his hostess regarded as her boudoir. The sound of music had come to him outside
the door, so that he was prepared to find her seated at the piano, if not to
see her continue to play after he appeared. Her face was turned in the
direction from which he entered, and she smiled at him while the servant, as if
he had just arrived, formally pronounced his name, without lifting her hands
from the keys. The room, placed in an angle of the house and lighted from two
sides, was large and sunny, upholstered in fresh, gay chintz, furnished with
all sorts of sofas and low, familiar seats and convenient little tables, most
of them holding great bowls of early flowers, littered over with books,
newspapers, magazines, photographs of celebrities, with their signatures, and
full of the marks of luxurious and rather indolent habitation. Hyacinth stood
there, not advancing very far, and the Princess, still playing and smiling,
nodded toward a seat near the piano. &ldquo;Put yourself there and listen to
me.&rdquo; Hyacinth obeyed, and she played a long time without glancing at him.
This left him the more free to rest his eyes on her own face and person, while
she looked about the room, vaguely, absently, but with an expression of quiet
happiness, as if she were lost in her music, soothed and pacified by it. A
window near her was half open, and the soft clearness of the day and all the
odour of the spring diffused themselves, and made the place cheerful and pure.
The Princess struck him as extraordinarily young and fair, and she seemed so
slim and simple, and friendly too, in spite of having neither abandoned her
occupation nor offered him her hand, that he sank back in his seat at last,
with the sense that all his uneasiness, his nervous tension, was leaving him,
and that he was safe in her kindness, in the free, original way with which she
evidently would always treat him. This peculiar manner&mdash;half
consideration, half fellowship&mdash;seemed to him already to have the
sweetness of familiarity. She played ever so movingly, with different pieces
succeeding each other; he had never listened to music, nor to a talent, of that
order. Two or three times she turned her eyes upon him, and then they shone
with the wonderful expression which was the essence of her beauty; that
profuse, mingled light which seemed to belong to some everlasting summer, and
yet to suggest seasons that were past and gone, some experience that was only
an exquisite memory. She asked him if he cared for music, and then added,
laughing, that she ought to have made sure of this before; while he
answered&mdash;he had already told her so in South Street; she appeared to have
forgotten&mdash;that he was awfully fond of it.
</p>

<p>
The sense of the beauty of women had been given to our young man in a high
degree; it was a faculty that made him conscious, to adoration, of every
element of loveliness, every delicacy of feature, every shade and tone, that
contributed to charm. Even, therefore, if he had appreciated less the deep
harmonies the Princess drew from the piano, there would have been no lack of
interest in his situation, in such an opportunity to watch her admirable
outline and movement, the noble form of her head and face, the gathered-up
glories of her hair, the living, flower-like freshness which had no need to
turn from the light. She was dressed in fair colours, as simply as a young
girl. Before she ceased playing she asked Hyacinth what he would like to do in
the afternoon: would he have any objection to taking a drive with her? It was
very possible he might enjoy the country. She seemed not to attend to his
answer, which was covered by the sound of the piano; but if she had done so it
would have left her very little doubt as to the reality of his inclination. She
remained gazing at the cornice of the room, while her hands wandered to and
fro; then suddenly she stopped, got up and came toward her companion. &ldquo;It
is probable that is the most I shall ever bore you; you know the worst. Would
you very kindly close the piano?&rdquo; He complied with her request, and she
went to another part of the room and sank into an arm-chair. When he approached
her again she said, &ldquo;Is it really true that you have never seen a park,
nor a garden, nor any of the beauties of nature, and that sort of thing?&rdquo;
She was alluding to something he had said in his letter, when he answered the
note by which she proposed to him to run down to Medley; and after he assured
her that it was perfectly true she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
glad&mdash;I&rsquo;m so glad! I have never been able to show any one anything
new, and I have always thought I should like it so&mdash;especially to a
sensitive nature. Then you <i>will</i> come and drive with me?&rdquo; She asked
this as if it would be a great favour.
</p>

<p>
That was the beginning of the communion&mdash;so singular, considering their
respective positions&mdash;which he had come to Medley to enjoy; and it passed
into some very remarkable phases. The Princess had the most extraordinary way
of taking things for granted, of ignoring difficulties, of assuming that her
preferences might be translated into fact. After Hyacinth had remained with her
ten minutes longer&mdash;a period mainly occupied with her exclamations of
delight at his having seen so little of the sort of thing of which Medley
consisted (Where should he have seen it, gracious heaven? he asked himself);
after she had rested, thus briefly, from her exertions at the piano, she
proposed that they should go out-of-doors together. She was an immense
walker&mdash;she wanted her walk. She left him for a short time, giving him the
last number of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> to entertain himself withal,
and calling his attention, in particular, to a story of M. Octave Feuillet (she
should be so curious to know what he thought of it); and reappeared with her
hat and parasol, drawing on her long gloves, and presenting herself to our
young man, at that moment, as a sudden incarnation of the heroine of M.
Feuillet&rsquo;s novel, in which he had instantly become immersed. On their way
downstairs it occurred to her that he had not yet seen the house and that it
would be amusing for her to show it to him; so she turned aside and took him
through it, up and down and everywhere, even into the vast, old-fashioned
kitchen, where there was a small, red-faced man in a white jacket and apron and
a white cap (he removed the latter ornament to salute the little bookbinder),
with whom his companion spoke Italian, which Hyacinth understood sufficiently
to perceive that she addressed her cook in the second person singular, as if he
had been a feudal retainer. He remembered that was the way the three Musketeers
spoke to their lackeys. The Princess explained that the gentleman in the white
cap was a delightful creature (she couldn&rsquo;t endure English servants,
though she was obliged to have two or three), who would make her plenty of
risottos and polentas&mdash;she had quite the palate of a contadina. She showed
Hyacinth everything: the queer transmogrified corner that had once been a
chapel; the secret stairway which had served in the persecutions of the
Catholics (the owners of Medley were, like the Princess herself, of the old
persuasion); the musicians&rsquo; gallery, over the hall; the tapestried room,
which people came from a distance to see; and the haunted chamber (the two were
sometimes confounded, but they were quite distinct), where a dreadful
individual at certain times made his appearance&mdash;a dwarfish ghost, with an
enormous head, a dispossessed brother, of long ago (the eldest), who had passed
for an idiot, which he wasn&rsquo;t, and had somehow been made away with. The
Princess offered her visitor the privilege of sleeping in this apartment,
declaring, however, that nothing would induce <i>her</i> even to enter it
alone, she being a benighted creature, consumed with abject superstitions.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I am religious, and whether, if I were, my
religion would be superstitious, but my superstitions are certainly
religious.&rdquo; She made her young friend pass through the drawing-room very
cursorily, remarking that they should see it again: it was rather
stupid&mdash;drawing-rooms in English country-houses were always stupid;
indeed, if it would amuse him, they would sit there after dinner. Madame
Grandoni and she usually sat upstairs, but they would do anything that he
should find more comfortable.
</p>

<p>
At last they went out of the house together, and as they did so she explained,
as if she wished to justify herself against the imputation of extravagance,
that, though the place doubtless struck him as absurdly large for a couple of
quiet women, and the whole thing was not in the least what she would have
preferred, yet it was all far cheaper than he probably imagined; she would
never have looked at it if it hadn&rsquo;t been cheap. It must appear to him so
preposterous for a woman to associate herself with the great uprising of the
poor and yet live in palatial halls&mdash;a place with forty or fifty rooms.
This was one of only two allusions she made that day to her democratic
sympathies; but it fell very happily, for Hyacinth had been reflecting
precisely upon the anomaly she mentioned. It had been present to him all day;
it added much to the way life practised on his sense of the tragic-comical to
think of the Princess&rsquo;s having retired to that magnificent residence in
order to concentrate her mind upon the London slums. He listened, therefore,
with great attention while she related that she had taken the house for only
three months, in any case, because she wanted to rest, after a winter of
visiting and living in public (as the English spent their lives, with all their
celebrated worship of the &lsquo;home&rsquo;), and yet didn&rsquo;t wish as yet
to return to town&mdash;though she was obliged to confess that she had still
the place in South Street on her hands, thanks to her deciding unexpectedly to
go on with it rather than move out her things. But one had to keep one&rsquo;s
things somewhere, and why wasn&rsquo;t that as good a receptacle as another?
Medley was not what she would have chosen if she had been left to herself; but
she had not been left to herself&mdash;she never was; she had been bullied into
taking it by the owners, whom she had met somewhere and who had made up to her
immensely, persuading her that she might really have it for nothing&mdash;for
no more than she would give for the little honeysuckle cottage, the old
parsonage embowered in clematis, which were really what she had been looking
for. Besides it was one of those old musty mansions, ever so far from town,
which it was always difficult to let, or to get a price for; and then it was a
wretched house for living in. Hyacinth, for whom his three hours in the train
had been a series of happy throbs, had not been struck with its geographical
remoteness, and he asked the Princess what she meant, in such a connection, by
using the word &lsquo;wretched&rsquo;. To this she replied that the place was
tumbling to pieces, inconvenient in every respect, full of ghosts and bad
smells. &ldquo;That is the only reason I come to have it. I don&rsquo;t want
you to think me more luxurious than I am, or that I throw away money. Never,
never!&rdquo; Hyacinth had no standard by which he could measure the importance
his opinion would have for her, and he perceived that though she judged him as
a creature still open to every initiation, whose <i>naïveté</i> would entertain
her, it was also her fancy to treat him as an old friend, a person to whom she
might have had the habit of referring her difficulties. Her performance of the
part she had undertaken to play was certainly complete, and everything lay
before him but the reason she had for playing it.
</p>

<p>
One of the gardens at Medley took the young man&rsquo;s heart beyond the
others; it had high brick walls, on the sunny sides of which was a great
training of apricots and plums, and straight walks, bordered with old-fashioned
homely flowers, inclosing immense squares where other fruit-trees stood upright
and mint and lavender floated in the air. In the southern quarter it overhung a
small, disused canal, and here a high embankment had been raised, which was
also long and broad and covered with fine turf; so that the top of it, looking
down at the canal, made a magnificent grassy terrace, than which, on a
summer&rsquo;s day, there could be no more delightful place for strolling up
and down with a companion&mdash;all the more that, at either end, was a curious
pavilion, in the manner of a tea-house, which completed the scene in an
old-world sense and offered rest and privacy, a refuge from sun or shower. One
of these pavilions was an asylum for gardeners&rsquo; tools and superfluous
flower-pots; the other was covered, inside, with a queer Chinese paper,
representing ever so many times over a group of people with faces like blind
kittens, having tea while they sat on the floor. It also contained a big,
clumsy inlaid cabinet, in which cups and saucers showed themselves through
doors of greenish glass, together with a carved cocoanut and a pair of
outlandish idols. On a shelf, over a sofa, not very comfortable though it had
cushions of faded tapestry, which looked like samplers, was a row of novels,
out of date and out of print&mdash;novels that one couldn&rsquo;t have found
any more and that were only there. On the chimney-piece was a bowl of dried
rose-leaves, mixed with some aromatic spice, and the whole place suggested a
certain dampness.
</p>

<p>
On the terrace Hyacinth paced to and fro with the Princess until she suddenly
remembered that he had not had his luncheon. He protested that this was the
last thing he wished to think of, but she declared that she had not asked him
down to Medley to starve him and that he must go back and be fed. They went
back, but by a very roundabout way, through the park, so that they really had
half an hour&rsquo;s more talk. She explained to him that she herself
breakfasted at twelve o&rsquo;clock, in the foreign fashion, and had tea in the
afternoon; as he too was so foreign he might like that better, and in this
case, on the morrow, they would breakfast together. He could have coffee, and
anything else he wanted, brought to his room when he woke up. When Hyacinth had
sufficiently composed himself, in the presence of this latter image&mdash;he
thought he saw a footman arranging a silver service at his bedside&mdash;he
mentioned that really, as regarded the morrow, he should have to be back in
London. There was a train at nine o&rsquo;clock; he hoped she didn&rsquo;t mind
his taking it. She looked at him a moment, gravely and kindly, as if she were
considering an abstract idea, and then she said, &ldquo;Oh yes, I mind it very
much. Not to-morrow&mdash;some other day.&rdquo; He made no rejoinder, and the
Princess spoke of something else; that is, his rejoinder was private, and
consisted of the reflection that he <i>would</i> leave Medley in the morning,
whatever she might say. He simply couldn&rsquo;t afford to stay; he
couldn&rsquo;t be out of work. And then Madame Grandoni thought it so
important; for though the old lady was obscure she was decidedly impressive.
The Princess&rsquo;s protest, however, was to be reckoned with; he felt that it
might take a form less cursory than the words she had just uttered, which would
make it embarrassing. She was less solemn, less explicit, than Madame Grandoni
had been, but there was something in her slight seriousness and the delicate
way in which she signified a sort of command that seemed to tell him his
liberty was going&mdash;the liberty he had managed to keep (till the other day,
when he gave Hoffendahl a mortgage on it), and the possession of which had in
some degree consoled him for other forms of penury. This made him uneasy; what
would become of him if he should add another servitude to the one he had
undertaken, at the end of that long, anxious cab-drive in the rain, in that dim
back-bedroom of a house as to whose whereabouts he was even now not clear,
while Muniment and Poupin and Schinkel, all visibly pale, listened and accepted
the vow? Muniment and Poupin and Schinkel&mdash;how disconnected, all the same,
he felt from them at the present hour; how little he was the young man who had
made the pilgrimage in the cab; and how the two latter, at least, if they could
have a glimpse of him now, would wonder what he was up to!
</p>

<p>
As to this, Hyacinth wondered sufficiently himself, while the Princess touched
upon the people and places she had seen, the impressions and conclusions she
had gathered, since their former meeting. It was to such matters as these that
she directed the conversation; she appeared to wish to keep it off his own
concerns, and he was surprised at her continued avoidance of the slums and the
question of her intended sacrifices. She mentioned none of her friends by name,
but she talked of their character, their houses, their manners, taking for
granted, as before, that Hyacinth would always follow. So far as he followed he
was edified, but he had to admit to himself that half the time he didn&rsquo;t
know what she was talking about. At all events, if <i>he</i> had been with the
dukes (she didn&rsquo;t call her associates dukes, but Hyacinth was sure they
were of that order), he would have got more satisfaction from them. She
appeared, on the whole, to judge the English world severely; to think poorly of
its wit, and even worse of its morals. &ldquo;You know people oughtn&rsquo;t to
be both corrupt and dull,&rdquo; she said; and Hyacinth turned this over,
feeling that he certainly had not yet caught the point of view of a person for
whom the aristocracy was a collection of bores. He had sometimes taken great
pleasure in hearing that it was fabulously profligate, but he was rather
disappointed in the bad account the Princess gave of it. She remarked that she
herself was very corrupt&mdash;she ought to have mentioned that
before&mdash;but she had never been accused of being stupid. Perhaps he would
discover it, but most of the people she had had to do with thought her only too
lively. The second allusion that she made to their ulterior designs
(Hyacinth&rsquo;s and hers) was when she said, &ldquo;I determined to see
it&rdquo;&mdash;she was speaking still of English society&mdash;&ldquo;to learn
for myself what it really is, before we blow it up. I have been here now a year
and a half, and, as I tell you, I feel that I have seen. It is the old régime
again, the rottenness and extravagance, bristling with every iniquity and every
abuse, over which the French Revolution passed like a whirlwind; or perhaps
even more a reproduction of Roman society in its decadence, gouty, apoplectic,
depraved, gorged and clogged with wealth and spoils, selfishness and
scepticism, and waiting for the onset of the barbarians. You and I are the
barbarians, you know.&rdquo; The Princess was pretty general, after all, in her
animadversions, and regaled him with no anecdotes (he rather missed them) that
would have betrayed the hospitality she had enjoyed. She couldn&rsquo;t treat
him absolutely as if he had been an ambassador. By way of defending the
aristocracy he said to her that it couldn&rsquo;t be true they were all a bad
lot (he used that expression because she had let him know that she liked him to
speak in the manner of the people), inasmuch as he had an acquaintance among
them&mdash;a noble lady&mdash;who was one of the purest, kindest, most
conscientious human beings it was possible to imagine. At this she stopped
short and looked at him; then she asked, &ldquo;Whom do you mean&mdash;a noble
lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose there is no harm saying. Lady Aurora Langrish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her. Is she nice?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like her ever so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she pretty, clever?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t pretty, but she is very uncommon,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you make her acquaintance?&rdquo; As he hesitated, she went on,
&ldquo;Did you bind some books for her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I met her in a place called Audley Court.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In Camberwell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who lives there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A young woman I was calling on, who is bedridden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the lady you speak of&mdash;what do you call her, Lydia
Languish?&mdash;goes to see her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very often.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess was silent a moment, looking at him. &ldquo;Will you take me
there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With great pleasure. The young woman I speak of is the sister of the
chemist&rsquo;s assistant you will perhaps remember that I mentioned to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I remember. It must be one of the first places we go to. I am
sorry,&rdquo; the Princess added, walking on. Hyacinth inquired what she might
be sorry for, but she took no notice of his question, and presently remarked,
&ldquo;Perhaps she goes to see him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goes to see whom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The chemist&rsquo;s assistant&mdash;the brother.&rdquo; She said this
very seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps she does,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined, laughing. &ldquo;But she is
a fine sort of woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess repeated that she was sorry, and he again asked her for
what&mdash;for Lady Aurora&rsquo;s being of that sort? To which she replied,
&ldquo;No; I mean for my not being the first&mdash;what is it you call
them?&mdash;noble lady that you have encountered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what difference that makes. You needn&rsquo;t be
afraid you don&rsquo;t make an impression on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was not thinking of that. I was thinking that you might be less fresh
than I thought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t know what you thought,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; how should you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was in the library, after luncheon, when word was brought to him that the
carriage was at the door, for their drive; and when he went into the hall he
found Madame Grandoni, bonneted and cloaked, awaiting the descent of the
Princess. &ldquo;You see I go with you. I am always there,&rdquo; she remarked,
jovially. &ldquo;The Princess has me with her to take care of her, and this is
how I do it. Besides, I never miss my drive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are different from me; this will be the first I have ever had in my
life.&rdquo; He could establish that distinction without bitterness, because he
was too pleased with his prospect to believe the old lady&rsquo;s presence
could spoil it. He had nothing to say to the Princess that she might not hear.
He didn&rsquo;t dislike her for coming, even after she had said to him, in
answer to his own announcement, speaking rather more sententiously than was her
wont, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that you have not spent your life in
carriages. They have nothing to do with your trade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fortunately not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I should have made a
ridiculous coachman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess appeared, and they mounted into a great square barouche, an
old-fashioned, high-hung vehicle, with a green body, a faded hammer-cloth and a
rumble where the footman sat (the Princess mentioned that it had been let with
the house), which rolled ponderously and smoothly along the winding avenue and
through the gilded gates (they were surmounted with an immense escutcheon) of
the park. The progress of this oddly composed trio had a high respectability,
and that is one of the reasons why Hyacinth felt the occasion to be
tremendously memorable. There might still be greater joys in store for
him&mdash;he was by this time quite at sea, and could recognise no
shores&mdash;but he would never again in his life be so respectable. The drive
was long and comprehensive, but very little was said while it lasted. &ldquo;I
shall show you the whole country: it is exquisitely beautiful; it speaks to the
heart.&rdquo; Of so much as this his hostess had informed him at the start; and
she added, in French, with a light, allusive nod at the rich, humanised
landscape, &ldquo;<i>Voilà ce que j&rsquo;aime en Angleterre</i>.&rdquo; For
the rest, she sat there opposite to him, in quiet fairness, under her
softly-swaying, lace-fringed parasol: moving her eyes to where she noticed that
his eyes rested; allowing them, when the carriage passed anything particularly
charming, to meet his own; smiling as if she enjoyed the whole affair very
nearly as much as he; and now and then calling his attention to some prospect,
some picturesque detail, by three words of which the cadence was sociable.
Madame Grandoni dozed most of the time, with her chin resting on rather a mangy
ermine tippet, in which she had enveloped herself; expanding into consciousness
at moments, however, to greet the scenery with comfortable polyglot
ejaculations. If Hyacinth was exalted, during these delightful hours, he at
least measured his exaltation, and it kept him almost solemnly still, as if
with the fear that a wrong movement of any sort would break the charm, cause
the curtain to fall upon the play. This was especially the case when his senses
oscillated back from the objects that sprang up by the way, every one of which
was a rich image of something he had longed for, to the most beautiful woman in
England, who sat there, close to him, as completely for his benefit as if he
had been a painter engaged to make her portrait. More than once he saw
everything through a mist; his eyes were full of tears.
</p>

<p>
That evening they sat in the drawing-room after dinner, as the Princess had
promised, or, as he was inclined to consider it, threatened him. The force of
the threat was in his prevision that the ladies would make themselves fine, and
that in contrast with the setting and company he should feel dingier than ever;
having already on his back the only tolerably decent coat he possessed, and
being unable to exchange it for a garment of the pattern that civilised people
(so much he knew, if he couldn&rsquo;t emulate them) put on about eight
o&rsquo;clock. The ladies, when they came to dinner, looked festal indeed; but
Hyacinth was able to make the reflection that he was more pleased to be dressed
as he was dressed, meanly and unsuitably as it was, than he should have been to
present such a figure as Madame Grandoni, in whose toggery there was something
comical. He was coming more and more round to the sense that if the Princess
didn&rsquo;t mind his poorness, in every way, he had no call to mind it
himself. His present circumstances were not of his seeking&mdash;they had been
forced upon him; they were not the fruit of a disposition to push. How little
the Princess minded&mdash;how much, indeed, she enjoyed the consciousness that
in having him about her in that manner she was playing a trick upon society,
the false and conventional society she had measured and despised&mdash;was
manifest from the way she had introduced him to the people they found awaiting
them in the hall on the return from their drive: four ladies, a mother and
three daughters, who had come over to call, from Broome, a place some five
miles off. Broome was also a great house, as he gathered, and Lady Marchant,
the mother, was the wife of a county magnate. She explained that they had come
in on the persuasion of the butler, who had represented the return of the
Princess as imminent, and who then had administered tea without waiting for
this event. The evening had drawn in chill; there was a fire in the hall, and
they all sat near it, round the tea-table, under the great roof which rose to
the top of the house. Hyacinth conversed mainly with one of the daughters, a
very fine girl with a straight back and long arms, whose neck was encircled so
tightly with a fur boa that, to look a little to one side, she was obliged to
move her whole body. She had a handsome, inanimate face, over which the
firelight played without making it more lively, a beautiful voice, and the
occasional command of a few short words. She asked Hyacinth with what pack he
hunted, and whether he went in much for tennis, and she ate three muffins.
</p>

<p>
Our young man perceived that Lady Marchant and her daughters had already been
at Medley, and even guessed that their reception by the Princess, who probably
thought them of a tiresome type, had not been enthusiastic; and his imagination
projected itself, further still, into the motives which, in spite of this
tepidity, must have led them, in consideration of the rarity of princesses in
that country, to come a second time. The talk, in the firelight, while Hyacinth
laboured, rather recklessly (for the spirit of the occasion, on his
hostess&rsquo;s part, was passing into his own blood), with his muffin-eating
beauty&mdash;the conversation, accompanied with the light click of delicate
tea-cups, was as well-bred as could be consistent with an odd, evident
<i>parti-pris</i> of the Princess&rsquo;s to make poor Lady Marchant explain
everything. With great urbanity of manner, she professed complete inability to
understand the sense in which her visitor meant her thin remarks; and Hyacinth
was scarcely able to follow her here, he wondered so what interest she could
have in trying to appear dense. It was only afterwards he learned that the
Marchant family produced a very peculiar, and at moments almost maddening,
effect upon her nerves. He asked himself what would happen to that member of it
with whom he was engaged if it should be revealed to her that she was
conversing (how little soever) with a beggarly London artisan; and though he
was rather pleased at her not having discovered his station (for he
didn&rsquo;t attribute her brevity to this idea), he entertained a little the
question of its being perhaps his duty not to keep it hidden from her, not to
flourish in a cowardly disguise. What did she take him for&mdash;or, rather,
what didn&rsquo;t she take him for&mdash;when she asked him if he hunted?
Perhaps that was because it was rather dark; if there had been more light in
the great vague hall she would have seen he was not one of themselves. Hyacinth
felt that by this time he had associated a good deal with swells, but they had
always known what he was and had been able to elect how to treat him. This was
the first occasion on which a young gentlewoman had not been warned, and, as a
consequence, he appeared to pass muster. He determined not to unmask himself,
on the simple ground that he should by the same stroke betray the Princess. It
was quite open to her to lean over and say to Miss Marchant, &ldquo;You know
he&rsquo;s a wretched little bookbinder, earning a few shillings a week in a
horrid street in Soho. There are all kinds of low things&mdash;and I suspect
even something very horrible&mdash;connected with his birth. It seems to me I
ought to mention it.&rdquo; He almost wished she would mention it, for the sake
of the strange, violent sensation of the thing, a curiosity quivering within
him to know what Miss Marchant would do at such a pinch, and what chorus of
ejaculations&mdash;or, what appalled, irremediable silence&mdash;would rise to
the painted roof. The responsibility, however, was not his; he had entered a
phase of his destiny where responsibilities were suspended. Madame
Grandoni&rsquo;s tea had waked her up; she came, at every crisis, to the rescue
of the conversation, and talked to the visitors about Rome, where they had once
spent a winter, describing with much drollery the manner in which the English
families she had seen there for nearly half a century (and had met, of an
evening, in the Roman world) inspected the ruins and monuments and squeezed
into the great ceremonies of the church. Clearly, the four ladies didn&rsquo;t
know what to make of the Princess; but, though they perhaps wondered if she
were a paid companion, they were on firm ground in the fact that the queer,
familiar, fat person had been acquainted with the Millingtons, the Bunburys and
the Tripps.
</p>

<p>
After dinner (during which the Princess allowed herself a considerable license
of pleasantry on the subject of her recent visitors, declaring that Hyacinth
must positively go with her to return their call, and must see their interior,
their manner at home), Madame Grandoni sat down to the piano, at
Christina&rsquo;s request, and played to her companions for an hour. The spaces
were large in the big drawing-room, and our friends had placed themselves at a
distance from each other. The old lady&rsquo;s music trickled forth discreetly
into the pleasant dimness of the candlelight; she knew dozens of Italian local
airs, which sounded like the forgotten tunes of a people, and she followed them
by a series of tender, plaintive German <i>Lieder</i>, awaking, without
violence, the echoes of the high, pompous apartment. It was the music of an old
woman, and seemed to quaver a little, as her singing might have done. The
Princess, buried in a deep chair, listened, behind her fan. Hyacinth at least
supposed she listened; at any rate, she never moved. At last Madame Grandoni
left the piano and came toward the young man. She had taken up, on the way, a
French book, in a pink cover, which she nursed in the hollow of her arm, and
she stood looking at Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor little friend, I must bid you good-night. I shall not see you
again for the present, as, to take your early train, you will have left the
house before I put on my wig&mdash;and I never show myself to gentlemen without
it. I have looked after the Princess pretty well, all day, to keep her from
harm, and now I give her up to you, for a little. Take the same care, I beg
you. I must put myself into my dressing-gown; at my age, at this hour, it is
the only thing. What will you have? I hate to be tight,&rdquo; pursued Madame
Grandoni, who appeared even in her ceremonial garment to have evaded this
discomfort successfully enough. &ldquo;Do not sit up late,&rdquo; she added;
&ldquo;and do not keep him, Christina. Remember that for an active young man
like Mr Robinson, going every day to his work, there is nothing more exhausting
than such an unoccupied life as ours. For what do we do, after all? His eyes
are very heavy. <i>Basta!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
During this little address the Princess, who made no rejoinder to that part of
it which concerned herself, remained hidden behind her fan; but after Madame
Grandoni had wandered away she lowered this emblazoned shield and rested her
eyes for a while on Hyacinth. At last she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit half a
mile off. Come nearer to me. I want to say something to you that I can&rsquo;t
shout across the room.&rdquo; Hyacinth instantly got up, but at the same moment
she also rose; so that, approaching each other, they met half-way, before the
great marble chimney-piece. She stood a little, opening and closing her fan;
then she remarked, &ldquo;You must be surprised at my not having yet spoken to
you about our great interest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, I am not surprised at anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you take that tone I feel as if we should never, after all, become
friends,&rdquo; said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hoped we were, already. Certainly, after the kindness you have shown
me, there is no service of friendship that you might ask of me&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That you wouldn&rsquo;t gladly perform? I know what you are going to
say, and have no doubt you speak truly. But what good would your service do me
if, all the while, you think of me as a hollow-headed, hollow-hearted trifler,
behaving in the worst possible taste and oppressing you with her attentions?
Perhaps you can think of me as&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;as a kind of
coquette.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth demurred. &ldquo;That would be very conceited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, you have the right to be as conceited as you please, after the
advances I have made you! Pray, who has a better one? But you persist in
remaining humble, and that is very provoking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not I that am provoking; it is life, and society, and all the
difficulties that surround us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am precisely of that opinion&mdash;that they are exasperating; that
when I appeal to you, frankly, candidly, disinterestedly&mdash;simply because I
like you, for no other reason in the world&mdash;to help me to disregard and
surmount these obstructions, to treat them with the contempt they deserve, you
drop your eyes, you even blush a little, and make yourself small, and try to
edge out of the situation by pleading general devotion and insignificance.
Please remember this: you cease to be insignificant from the moment I have
anything to do with you. My dear fellow,&rdquo; the Princess went on, in her
free, audacious, fraternising way, to which her beauty and simplicity gave
nobleness, &ldquo;there are people who would be very glad to enjoy, in your
place, that form of obscurity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, as quietly as he
could.
</p>

<p>
If he had had an idea that this question, to which, as coming from his lips,
and even as being uttered with perceptible impatience, a certain unexpectedness
might attach, would cause her a momentary embarrassment, he was completely out
in his calculation. She answered on the instant: &ldquo;I want you to give me
time! That&rsquo;s all I ask of my friends, in general&mdash;all I ever asked
of the best I have had. But none of them ever did it; none of them, that is,
save the excellent creature who has just left us. She understood me long
ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I, on my side, ask of you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth,
smiling. &ldquo;Give me time, give me time,&rdquo; he murmured, looking up at
her splendour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Mr Hyacinth, I have given you mouths!&mdash;months since our first
meeting. And at present, haven&rsquo;t I given you the whole day? It has been
intentional, my not speaking to you of our plans. Yes, our plans; I know what I
am saying. Don&rsquo;t try to look stupid; you will never succeed. I wished to
leave you free to amuse yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have amused myself,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would have been very fastidious if you hadn&rsquo;t! However, that
is precisely, in the first place, what I wished you to come here for. To
observe the impression made by such a place as this on such a nature as yours,
introduced to it for the first time, has been, I assure you, quite worth my
while. I have already given you a hint of how extraordinary I think it that you
should be what you are without having seen&mdash;what shall I call
them?&mdash;beautiful, delightful old things. I have been watching you; I am
frank enough to tell you that. I want you to see
more&mdash;more&mdash;more!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed, with a sudden
flicker of passion. &ldquo;And I want to talk with you about this matter, as
well as others. That will be for to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I noticed Madame Grandoni took for granted just now that you are going.
But that has nothing to do with the business. She has so little
imagination!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth shook his head, smiling. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay!&rdquo; He had an
idea his mind was made up.
</p>

<p>
She returned his smile, but there was something strangely touching&mdash;it was
so sad, yet, as a rebuke, so gentle&mdash;in the tone in which she replied,
&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to force me to beg. It isn&rsquo;t nice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had reckoned without that tone; all his reasons suddenly seemed to fall from
under him, to liquefy. He remained a moment, looking on the ground; then he
said, &ldquo;Princess, you have no idea&mdash;how should you have?&mdash;into
the midst of what abject, pitiful preoccupations you thrust yourself. I have no
money&mdash;I have no clothes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want of money? This isn&rsquo;t an hotel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every day I stay here I lose a day&rsquo;s wages; and I live on my wages
from day to day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me, then, give you wages. You will work for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;work for you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will bind all my books. I have ever so many foreign ones, in
paper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You speak as if I had brought my tools!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t imagine that. I will give you the wages now, and you
can do the work, at your leisure and convenience, afterwards. Then, if you want
anything, you can go over to Bonchester and buy it. There are very good shops;
I have used them.&rdquo; Hyacinth thought of a great many things at this
juncture; the Princess had that quickening effect upon him. Among others, he
thought of these two: first, that it was indelicate (though such an opinion was
not very strongly held either in Pentonville or in Soho) to accept money from a
woman; and second, that it was still more indelicate to make such a woman as
that go down on her knees to him. But it took more than a minute for one of
these convictions to prevail over the other, and before that he had heard the
Princess continue, in the tone of mild, disinterested argument: &ldquo;If we
believe in the coming democracy, if it seems to us right and just, and we hold
that in sweeping over the world the great wave will wash away a myriad
iniquities and cruelties, why not make some attempt, with our own poor
means&mdash;for one must begin somewhere&mdash;to carry out the spirit of it in
our lives and our manners? I want to do that. I try to do it&mdash;in my
relations with you, for instance. But you hang back; you are not
democratic!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess accusing him of a patrician offishness was a very fine stroke;
nevertheless it left him lucidity enough (though he still hesitated an instant,
wondering whether the words would not offend her) to say, with a smile,
&ldquo;I have been strongly warned against you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The offence seemed not to touch her. &ldquo;I can easily understand that. Of
course my proceedings&mdash;though, after all, I have done little enough as
yet&mdash;must appear most unnatural. <i>Che vuole?</i> as Madame Grandoni
says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A certain knot of light blue ribbon, which formed part of the trimming of her
dress, hung down, at her side, in the folds of it. On these glossy loops
Hyacinth&rsquo;s eyes happened for a moment to have rested, and he now took one
of them up and carried it to his lips. &ldquo;I will do all the work for you
that you will give me. If you give it on purpose, by way of munificence, that
is your own affair. I myself will estimate the price. What decides me is that I
shall do it so well; at least it shall be better than any one else can
do&mdash;so that if you employ me there will have been that reason. I have
brought you a book&mdash;so you can see. I did it for you last year, and went
to South Street to give it to you, but you had already gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give it to me to-morrow.&rdquo; These words appeared to express so
exclusively the calmness of relief at finding that he could be reasonable, as
well as that of a friendly desire to see the proof of his talent, that he was
surprised when she said, in the next breath, irrelevantly, &ldquo;Who was it
warned you against me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He feared she might suppose he meant Madame Grandoni, so he made the plainest
answer, having no desire to betray the old lady, and reflecting that, as the
likelihood was small that his friend in Camberwell would ever consent to meet
the Princess (in spite of her plan of going there), no one would be hurt by it.
&ldquo;A friend of mine in London&mdash;Paul Muniment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Paul Muniment?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I mentioned him to you the first time we met.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The person who said something good? I forget what it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was sure to be something good if he said it; he is very wise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That makes his warning very flattering to me! What does he know about
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing, of course, except the little that I could tell him. He only
spoke on general grounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like his name&mdash;Paul Muniment,&rdquo; the Princess said. &ldquo;If
he resembles it, I think I should like him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would like him much better than me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know how much&mdash;or how little&mdash;I like you? I am
determined to keep hold of you, simply for what you can show me.&rdquo; She
paused a moment, with her beautiful, intelligent eyes smiling into his own, and
then she continued, &ldquo;On general grounds, <i>bien entendu</i>, your friend
was quite right to warn you. Now those general grounds are just what I have
undertaken to make as small as possible. It is to reduce them to nothing that I
talk to you, that I conduct myself with regard to you as I have done. What in
the world is it I am trying to do but, by every device that my ingenuity
suggests, fill up the inconvenient gulf that yawns between my position and
yours? You know what I think of &lsquo;positions&rsquo;; I told you in London.
For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let me feel that I have&mdash;a
little&mdash;succeeded!&rdquo; Hyacinth satisfied her sufficiently to enable
her, five minutes later, apparently to entertain no further doubt on the
question of his staying over. On the contrary, she burst into a sudden
ebullition of laughter, exchanging her bright, lucid insistence for one of her
singular sallies. &ldquo;You must absolutely go with me to call on the
Marchants; it will be too delightful to see you there!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he walked up and down the empty drawing-room it occurred to him to ask
himself whether that was mainly what she was keeping him for&mdash;so that he
might help her to play one of her tricks on the good people at Broome. He paced
there, in the still candlelight, for a longer time than he measured; until the
butler came and stood in the doorway, looking at him silently and fixedly, as
if to let him know that he interfered with the custom of the house. He had told
the Princess that what determined him was the thought of the manner in which he
might exercise his craft in her service; but this was only half the influence
that pressed him into forgetfulness of what he had most said to himself when,
in Lomax Place, in an hour of unprecedented introspection, he wrote the letter
by which he accepted the invitation to Medley. He would go there (so he said)
because a man must be gallant, especially if he be a little bookbinder; but
after he should be there he would insist at every step upon knowing what he was
in for. The change that had taken place in him now, from one moment to another,
was that he had simply ceased to care what he was in for. All warnings,
reflections, considerations of verisimilitude, of the delicate, the natural and
the possible, of the value of his independence, had become as nothing to him.
The cup of an exquisite experience&mdash;a week in that enchanted palace, a
week of such immunity from Lomax Place and old Crookenden as he had never
dreamed of&mdash;was at his lips; it was purple with the wine of novelty, of
civilisation, and he couldn&rsquo;t push it aside without drinking. He might go
home ashamed, but he would have for evermore in his mouth the taste of nectar.
He went upstairs, under the eye of the butler, and on his way to his room, at
the turning of a corridor, found himself face to face with Madame Grandoni. She
had apparently just issued from her own apartment, the door of which stood
open, near her; she might have been hovering there in expectation of his
footstep. She had donned her dressing-gown, which appeared to give her every
facility for respiration, but she had not yet parted with her wig. She still
had her pink French book under her arm; and her fat little hands, tightly
locked together in front of her, formed the clasp of her generous girdle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do tell me it is positive, Mr Robinson!&rdquo; she said, stopping short.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is positive, Madame Grandoni?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That you take the train in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that, because it wouldn&rsquo;t be true. On the
contrary, it has been settled that I shall stay over. I am very sorry if it
distresses you&mdash;but <i>che vuole?</i>&rdquo; Hyacinth added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni was a humorous woman, but she gave him no smile in return; she
only looked at him a moment, and then, shrugging her shoulders silently but
expressively, shuffled back to her room.

<h3><a name="chap24"></a>XXIV</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;I can give you your friend&rsquo;s name&mdash;in a single guess. He is
Diedrich Hoffendahl!&rdquo; They had been strolling more and more slowly, the
next morning, and as she made this announcement the Princess stopped
altogether, standing there under a great beech with her eyes upon
Hyacinth&rsquo;s and her hands full of primroses. He had breakfasted at noon,
with his hostess and Madame Grandoni, but the old lady had fortunately not
joined them when the Princess afterwards proposed that he should accompany her
on her walk in the park. She told him that her venerable friend had let her
know, while the day was still very young, that she thought it in the worst
possible taste of the Princess not to have allowed Mr Robinson to depart; to
which Christina had replied that concerning tastes there was no disputing and
that they had disagreed on such matters before without any one being the worse.
Hyacinth expressed the hope that they wouldn&rsquo;t dispute about
<i>him</i>&mdash;of all thankless subjects in the world; and the Princess
assured him that she never disputed about anything. She held that there were
other ways than that of arranging one&rsquo;s relations with people; and
Hyacinth guessed that she meant that when a difference became sharp she broke
off altogether. On her side, then, there was as little possibility as on his
that they should ever quarrel; their acquaintance would be a solid friendship
or it would be nothing at all. The Princess gave it from hour to hour more of
this quality, and it may be imagined how safe Hyacinth felt by the time he
began to tell her that something had happened to him, in London, three months
before, one night (or rather in the small hours of the morning), that had
altered his life altogether&mdash;had, indeed, as he might say, changed the
terms on which he held it. He was aware that he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what
he meant by this last phrase; but it expressed sufficiently well the new
feeling that had come over him since that interminable, tantalising cab-drive
in the rain.
</p>

<p>
The Princess had led to this, almost as soon as they left the house; making up
for her avoidance of such topics the day before by saying, suddenly, &ldquo;Now
tell me what is going on among your friends. I don&rsquo;t mean your worldly
acquaintances, but your colleagues, your brothers. <i>Où en êtes-vous</i>, at
the present time? Is there anything new, is anything going to be done; I am
afraid you are always simply dawdling and muddling.&rdquo; Hyacinth felt as if,
of late, he had by no means either dawdled or muddled; but before he had
committed himself so far as to refute the imputation the Princess exclaimed, in
another tone, &ldquo;How annoying it is that I can&rsquo;t ask you anything
without giving you the right to say to yourself, &lsquo;After all, what do I
know? May she not be in the pay of the police?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t occur to me,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It might, at all events; by which I mean it may, at any moment. Indeed,
I think it ought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you were in the pay of the police you wouldn&rsquo;t trouble your
head about me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should make you think that, certainly! That would be my first care.
However, if you have no tiresome suspicions so much the better,&rdquo; said the
Princess; and she pressed him again for some news from behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his absence of doubt on the subject of her honesty&mdash;he felt
that he should never again entertain any such trumpery idea as that she might
be an agent on the wrong side&mdash;he did not open himself immediately; but at
the end of half an hour he let her know that the most important event of his
life had taken place, scarcely more than the other day, in the most unexpected
manner. And to explain in what it had consisted, he said, &ldquo;I pledged
myself, by everything that is sacred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To what did you pledge yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I took a vow&mdash;a tremendous, terrible vow&mdash;in the presence of
four witnesses,&rdquo; Hyacinth went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what was it about, your vow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I gave my life away,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him askance, as if to see how he would make such an announcement
as that; but she wore no smile&mdash;her face was politely grave. They moved
together a moment, exchanging a glance, in silence, and then she said,
&ldquo;Ah, well, then, I&rsquo;m all the more glad you stayed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was one of the reasons.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you had waited&mdash;till after you had been here,&rdquo; the
Princess remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why till after I had been here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps then you wouldn&rsquo;t have given away your life. You might
have seen reasons for keeping it.&rdquo; And now, at last, she treated the
matter gaily, as Hyacinth had done. He replied that he had not the least doubt
that, on the whole, her influence was relaxing; but without heeding this remark
she went on: &ldquo;Be so good as to tell me what you are talking about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you, but I&rsquo;ll give you no names,&rdquo;
said Hyacinth; and he related what had happened in the back-room in Bloomsbury,
in the course of that evening of which I have given some account. The Princess
listened, intently, while they strolled under the budding trees with a more
interrupted step. Never had the old oaks and beeches, renewing themselves in
the sunshine as they did to-day, or naked in some gray November, witnessed such
an extraordinary series of confidences, since the first pair that sought
isolation wandered over the grassy slopes and ferny dells beneath them. Among
other things Hyacinth mentioned to his companion that he didn&rsquo;t go to the
&lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo; any more; he now perceived, what he ought to have
perceived long before, that this particular temple of their faith, and
everything that pretended to get hatched there, was a hopeless sham. He had
been a rare muff, from the first, to take it seriously. He had done so mainly
because a friend of his, in whom he had confidence, appeared to set him the
example; but now it turned out that this friend (it was Paul Muniment again, by
the way) had always thought the men who went there a pack of duffers and was
only trying them because he tried everything. There was nobody you could begin
to call a first-rate man there, putting aside another friend of his, a
Frenchman named Poupin&mdash;and Poupin was magnificent, but he wasn&rsquo;t
first-rate. Hyacinth had a standard, now that he had seen a man who was the
very incarnation of his programme. You felt that <i>he</i> was a big chap the
very moment you came into his presence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Into whose presence, Mr Robinson?&rdquo; the Princess inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ought to tell you, much as I believe in you! I
am speaking of the very remarkable individual with whom I entered into that
engagement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To give away your life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To do something which in a certain contingency he will require of me. He
will require my poor little carcass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those plans have a way of failing&mdash;unfortunately,&rdquo; the
Princess murmured, adding the last word more quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that a consolation, or a lament?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked. &ldquo;This
one shall not fail, so far as it depends on me. They wanted an obliging young
man&mdash;the place was vacant&mdash;I stepped in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt you are right. We must pay for what we do.&rdquo; The
Princess made that remark calmly and coldly; then she said, &ldquo;I think I
know the person in whose power you have placed yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly, but I doubt it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t believe I have already gone so far? Why not? I have
given you a certain amount of proof that I don&rsquo;t hang back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you know my friend, you have gone very far indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess appeared to be on the point of pronouncing a name; but she checked
herself, and asked suddenly, smiling, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they also want, by
chance, an obliging young woman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I happen to know he doesn&rsquo;t think much of women, my first-rate
man. He doesn&rsquo;t trust them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that why you call him first-rate? You have very nearly betrayed him
to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you imagine there is only one of that opinion?&rdquo; Hyacinth
inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only one who, having it, still remains a superior man. That&rsquo;s a
very difficult opinion to reconcile with others that it is important to
have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Schopenhauer did so, successfully,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How delightful that you should know Schopenhauer!&rdquo; the Princess
exclaimed. &ldquo;The gentleman I have in my eye is also German.&rdquo;
Hyacinth let this pass, not challenging her, because he wished not to be
challenged in return, and the Princess went on: &ldquo;Of course such an
engagement as you speak of must make a tremendous difference, in
everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has made this difference, that I have now a far other sense from any
I had before of the reality, the solidity, of what is being prepared. I was
hanging about outside, on the steps of the temple, among the loafers and the
gossips, but now I have been in the innermost sanctuary&mdash;I have seen the
holy of holies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s very dazzling?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Princess!&rdquo; sighed the young man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it <i>is</i> real, it <i>is</i> solid?&rdquo; she pursued.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I have been trying to make up my mind about,
for so long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is more strange than I can say. Nothing of it appears above the
surface; but there is an immense underworld, peopled with a thousand forms of
revolutionary passion and devotion. The manner in which it is organised is what
astonished me; I knew that, or thought I knew it, in a general way, but the
reality was a revelation. And on top of it all, society lives! People go and
come, and buy and sell, and drink and dance, and make money and make love, and
seem to know nothing and suspect nothing and think of nothing; and iniquities
flourish, and the misery of half the world is prated about as a
&lsquo;necessary evil&rsquo;, and generations rot away and starve, in the midst
of it, and day follows day, and everything is for the best in the best of
possible worlds. All that is one-half of it; the other half is that everything
is doomed! In silence, in darkness, but under the feet of each one of us, the
revolution lives and works. It is a wonderful, immeasurable trap, on the lid of
which society performs its antics. When once the machinery is complete, there
will be a great rehearsal. That rehearsal is what they want me for. The
invisible, impalpable wires are everywhere, passing through everything,
attaching themselves to objects in which one would never think of looking for
them. What could be more strange and incredible, for instance, than that they
should exist just here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You make me believe it,&rdquo; said the Princess, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It matters little whether one believes it or not!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have had a vision,&rdquo; the Princess continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Parbleu</i>, I have had a vision! So would you, if you had been
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I had!&rdquo; she declared, in a tone charged with such ambiguous
implications that Hyacinth, catching them a moment after she had spoken,
rejoined, with a quick, incongruous laugh&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you would have spoiled everything. He made me see, he made me feel,
he made me do, everything he wanted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why should he have wanted you, in particular?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply because I struck him as the right person. That&rsquo;s his
affair: I can&rsquo;t tell you. When he meets the right person he chalks him. I
sat on the bed. (There were only two chairs in the dirty little room, and by
way of a curtain his overcoat was hung up before the window.) He didn&rsquo;t
sit, himself; he leaned against the wall, straight in front of me, with his
hands behind him. He told me certain things, and his manner was extraordinarily
quiet. So was mine, I think I may say; and indeed it was only poor Poupin who
made a row. It was for my sake, somehow: he didn&rsquo;t think we were all
conscious enough; he wanted to call attention to my sublimity. There was no
sublimity about it&mdash;I simply couldn&rsquo;t help myself. He and the other
German had the two chairs, and Muniment sat on a queer old battered,
hair-covered trunk, a most foreign-looking article.&rdquo; Hyacinth had taken
no notice of the little ejaculation with which his companion greeted, in this
last sentence, the word &lsquo;other&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what did Mr Muniment say?&rdquo; she presently inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he said it was all right. Of course he thought that, from the moment
he determined to bring me. He knew what the other fellow was looking
for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Then the Princess remarked, &ldquo;We have a curious way
of being fond of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whom do you mean by &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your friends. Mr Muniment and I, for instance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like it as well as any other. But you don&rsquo;t feel alike. I have
an idea you are sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sorry for what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I have put my head in a noose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re severe&mdash;I thought I concealed it so well!&rdquo;
the Princess exclaimed. He admitted that he had been severe, and begged her
pardon, for he was by no means sure that there was not a hint of tears in her
voice. She looked away from him for a minute, and it was after this that,
stopping short, she remarked, as I have related, &ldquo;He is Diedrich
Hoffendahl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stared for a moment, with parted lips. &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> in
it, more than I supposed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know he doesn&rsquo;t trust women,&rdquo; his companion smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why in the world should you have cared for any light <i>I</i> can throw,
if you have ever been in relation with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a little. &ldquo;Oh, you are very different. I like you
better,&rdquo; she added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, if it&rsquo;s for that!&rdquo; murmured Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
The Princess coloured, as he had seen her colour before, and in this accident,
on her part, there was an unexpectedness, something touching.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to fix my inconsistencies on me,&rdquo; she said, with
an humility which matched her blush. &ldquo;Of course there are plenty of them,
but it will always be kinder of you to let them pass. Besides, in this case
they are not so serious as they seem. As a product of the &lsquo;people&rsquo;,
and of that strange, fermenting underworld (what you say of it is so true!),
you interest me more, and have more to say to me, even than
Hoffendahl&mdash;wonderful creature as he assuredly is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you object to telling me how and where you came to know
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Through a couple of friends of mine in Vienna, two of the affiliated,
both passionate revolutionists and clever men. They are Neapolitans, originally
<i>poveretti</i>, like yourself, who emigrated, years ago, to seek their
fortune. One of them is a teacher of singing, the wisest, most accomplished
person in his line I have ever known. The other, if you please, is a
confectioner! He makes the most delicious <i>pâtisserie fine</i>. It would take
long to tell you how I made <i>their</i> acquaintance, and how they put me into
relation with the Maestro, as they called him, of whom they spoke with bated
breath. It is not from yesterday&mdash;though you don&rsquo;t seem able to
believe it&mdash;that I have had a care for all this business. I wrote to
Hoffendahl, and had several letters from him; the singing-master and the
pastry-cook went bail for my sincerity. The next year I had an interview with
him at Wiesbaden; but I can&rsquo;t tell you the circumstances of our meeting,
in that place, without implicating another person, to whom, at present at
least, I have no right to give you a clue. Of course Hoffendahl made an immense
impression on me; he seemed to me the Master indeed, the very genius of a new
social order, and I fully understand the manner in which you were affected by
him. When he was in London, three months ago, I knew it, and I knew where to
write to him. I did so, and asked him if he wouldn&rsquo;t see me somewhere. I
said I would meet him in any hole he should designate. He answered by a
charming letter, which I will show you&mdash;there is nothing in the least
compromising in it&mdash;but he declined my offer, pleading his short stay and
a press of engagements. He will write to me, but he won&rsquo;t trust me.
However, he shall some day!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was thrown quite off his balance by this representation of the ground
the Princess had already traversed, and the explanation was still but half
restorative when, on his asking her why she hadn&rsquo;t exhibited her titles
before, she replied, &ldquo;Well, I thought my being quiet was the better way
to draw you out.&rdquo; There was but little difficulty in drawing him out now,
and before their walk was over he had told her more definitely what Hoffendahl
demanded. This was simply that he should hold himself ready, for the next five
years, to do, at a given moment, an act which would in all probability cost him
his life. The act was as yet indefinite, but one might get an idea of it from
the penalty involved, which would certainly be capital. The only thing settled
was that it was to be done instantly and absolutely, without a question, a
hesitation or a scruple, in the manner that should be prescribed, at the
moment, from headquarters. Very likely it would be to kill some one&mdash;some
humbug in a high place; but whether the individual should deserve it or should
not deserve it was not Hyacinth&rsquo;s affair. If he recognised generally
Hoffendahl&rsquo;s wisdom&mdash;and the other night it had seemed to shine like
a northern aurora&mdash;it was not in order that he might challenge it in the
particular case. He had taken a vow of blind obedience, as the Jesuit fathers
did to the head of their order. It was because they had carried out their vows
(having, in the first place, great administrators) that their organisation had
been mighty, and that sort of mightiness was what people who felt as Hyacinth
and the Princess felt should go in for. It was not certain that he should be
collared, any more than it was certain that he should bring down his man; but
it was much to be looked for, and it was what he counted on and indeed
preferred. He should probably take little trouble to escape, and he should
never enjoy the idea of hiding (after the fact) or running away. If it were a
question of putting a bullet into some one, he himself should naturally deserve
what would come to him. If one did that sort of thing there was an indelicacy
in not being ready to pay for it; and he, at least, was perfectly willing. He
shouldn&rsquo;t judge; he should simply execute. He didn&rsquo;t pretend to say
what good his little job might do, or what <i>portée</i> it might have; he
hadn&rsquo;t the data for appreciating it, and simply took upon himself to
believe that at headquarters they knew what they were about. The thing was to
be a feature in a very large plan, of which he couldn&rsquo;t measure the
scope&mdash;something that was to be done simultaneously in a dozen different
countries. The effect was to be very much in this immense coincidence. It was
to be hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t be spoiled. At any rate, <i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t
hang fire, whatever the other fellows might do. He didn&rsquo;t say it because
Hoffendahl had done him the honour of giving him the business to do, but he
believed the Master knew how to pick out his men. To be sure, Hoffendahl had
known nothing about him in advance; he had only been suggested by those who
were looking out, from one day to the other. The fact remained however that
when Hyacinth stood before him he recognised him as the sort of little chap
that he had in his eye (one who could pass through a small orifice). Humanity,
in his scheme, was classified and subdivided with a truly German thoroughness,
and altogether of course from the point of view of the revolution, as it might
forward or obstruct it. Hyacinth&rsquo;s little job was a very small part of
what Hoffendahl had come to England for; he had in his hand innumerable other
threads. Hyacinth knew nothing of these, and didn&rsquo;t much want to know,
except that it was marvellous, the way Hoffendahl kept them apart. He had
exactly the same mastery of them that a great musician&mdash;that the Princess
herself&mdash;had of the keyboard of the piano; he treated all things, persons,
institutions, ideas, as so many notes in his great symphonic revolt. The day
would come when Hyacinth, far down in the treble, would feel himself touched by
the little finger of the composer, would become audible (with a small, sharp
crack) for a second.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible that our young man should not feel, at the end of ten
minutes, that he had charmed the Princess into the deepest, most genuine
attention; she was listening to him as she had never listened before. He
enjoyed having that effect upon her, and his sense of the tenuity of the thread
by which his future hung, renewed by his hearing himself talk about it, made
him reflect that at present anything in the line of enjoyment was so much
gained. The reader may judge whether he had passed through a phase of
excitement after finding himself on his new footing of utility in the world;
but that had finally spent itself, through a hundred forms of restlessness, of
vain conjecture&mdash;through an exaltation which alternated with despair and
which, equally with the despair, he concealed more successfully than he
supposed. He would have detested the idea that his companion might have heard
his voice tremble while he told his story; but though to-day he had really
grown used to his danger and resigned, as it were, to his consecration, and
though it could not fail to be agreeable to him to perceive that he was
thrilling, he could still not guess how very remarkable, in such a connection,
the Princess thought his composure, his lucidity and good-humour. It is true
she tried to hide her wonder, for she owed it to her self-respect to let it
still appear that even she was prepared for a personal sacrifice as complete.
She had the air&mdash;or she endeavoured to have it&mdash;of accepting for him
everything that he accepted for himself; nevertheless, there was something
rather forced in the smile (lovely as it was) with which she covered him, while
she said, after a little, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very serious&mdash;it&rsquo;s very
serious indeed, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He replied that the serious part was to
come&mdash;there was no particular grimness for him (comparatively) in
strolling in that sweet park and gossiping with her about the matter; and it
occurred to her presently to suggest to him that perhaps Hoffendahl would never
give him any sign at all, and he would wait all the while, <i>sur les
dents</i>, in a false suspense. He admitted that this would be a sell, but
declared that either way he would be sold, though differently; and that at any
rate he would have conformed to the great religious rule&mdash;to live each
hour as if it were to be one&rsquo;s last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In holiness, you mean&mdash;in great <i>recueillement?</i>&rdquo; the
Princess asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, no; simply in extreme thankfulness for every minute
that&rsquo;s added.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, there will probably be a great many,&rdquo; she rejoined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The more the better&mdash;if they are like this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be the case with many of them, in Lomax Place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure you that since that night Lomax Place has improved.&rdquo;
Hyacinth stood there, smiling, with his hands in his pockets and his hat pushed
back a little.
</p>

<p>
The Princess appeared to consider this fact with an extreme intellectual
curiosity. &ldquo;If, after all, then, you are not called, you will have been
positively happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall have had some fine moments. Perhaps Hoffendahl&rsquo;s plot is
simply for that; Muniment may have put him up to it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who knows? However, with me you must go on as if nothing were
changed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Changed from what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From the time of our first meeting at the theatre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on in any way you like,&rdquo; said Hyacinth; &ldquo;only
the real difference will be there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The real difference?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I shall have ceased to care for what you care about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough, now, to give my life to the beastly cause,&rdquo;
the young man broke out, &ldquo;without giving my sympathy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The beastly cause?&rdquo; the Princess murmured, opening her deep eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it is really just as holy as ever; only the people I find
myself pitying now are the rich, the happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see. You are very curious. Perhaps you pity my husband,&rdquo; the
Princess added in a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you call him one of the happy?&rdquo; Hyacinth inquired, as they
walked on again.
</p>

<p>
In answer to this she only repeated, &ldquo;You are very curious!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I have related the whole of this conversation, because it supplies a highly
important chapter of Hyacinth&rsquo;s history, but it will not be possible to
trace all the stages through which the friendship of the Princess Casamassima
with the young man she had constituted her bookbinder was confirmed. By the end
of a week the standard of fitness she had set up in the place of exploded
proprieties appeared the model of justice and convenience; and during this
period many other things happened. One of them was that Hyacinth drove over to
Broome with his hostess, and called on Lady Marchant and her daughters; an
episode from which the Princess appeared to derive an exquisite gratification.
When they came away he asked her why she hadn&rsquo;t told the ladies who he
was. Otherwise, where was the point? And she replied, &ldquo;Simply because
they wouldn&rsquo;t have believed me. That&rsquo;s your fault!&rdquo; This was
the same note she had struck when, the third day of his stay (the weather had
changed for the worse, and a rainy afternoon kept them in-doors), she remarked
to him, irrelevantly and abruptly, &ldquo;It <i>is</i> most extraordinary, your
knowing about Schopenhauer!&rdquo; He answered that she really seemed quite
unable to accustom herself to his little talents; and this led to a long talk,
longer than the one I have already narrated, in which he took her still further
into his confidence. Never had the pleasure of conversation (the greatest he
knew) been so largely opened to him. The Princess admitted, frankly, that he
would, to her sense, take a great deal of accounting for; she observed that he
was, no doubt, pretty well used to himself, but he must give other people time.
&ldquo;I have watched you, constantly, since you have been here, in every
detail of your behaviour, and I am more and more <i>intriguée</i>. You
haven&rsquo;t a vulgar intonation, you haven&rsquo;t a common gesture, you
never make a mistake, you do and say everything exactly in the right way. You
come out of the hole you have described to me, and yet you might have stayed in
country-houses all your life. You are much better than if you had! <i>Jugez
donc</i>, from the way I talk to you! I have to make no allowances. I have seen
Italians with that sort of natural tact and taste, but I didn&rsquo;t know one
ever found it in any Anglo-Saxon in whom it hadn&rsquo;t been cultivated at a
vast expense; unless, indeed, in certain little American women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean I&rsquo;m a gentleman?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, in a peculiar
tone, looking out into the wet garden.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated, and then she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I who make the
mistakes!&rdquo; Five minutes later she broke into an exclamation which touched
him almost more than anything she had ever done, giving him the highest opinion
of her delicacy and sympathy and putting him before himself as vividly as if
the words were a little portrait: &ldquo;Fancy the strange, the bitter fate: to
be constituted as you are constituted, to feel the capacity that you must feel,
and yet to look at the good things of life only through the glass of the
pastry-cook&rsquo;s window!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every class has its pleasures,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined, with perverse
sententiousness, in spite of his emotion; but the remark didn&rsquo;t darken
their mutual intelligence, and before they separated that evening he told her
the things that had never yet passed his lips&mdash;the things to which he had
awaked when he made Pinnie explain to him the visit to the prison. He told her,
in a word, what he was.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap25"></a>XXV</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth took several long walks by himself, beyond the gates of the park and
through the neighbouring country&mdash;walks during which, committed as he was
to reflection on the general &lsquo;rumness&rsquo; of his destiny, he had still
a delighted attention to spare for the green dimness of leafy lanes; the
attraction of meadow-paths that led from stile to stile and seemed a clue to
some pastoral happiness, some secret of the fields; the hedges thick with
flowers, bewilderingly common, for which he knew no names; the picture-making
quality of thatched cottages, the mystery and sweetness of blue distances, the
bloom of rural complexions, the quaintness of little girls bobbing curtsies by
waysides (a sort of homage he had never prefigured); the soft sense of the turf
under feet that had never ached but from paving-stones. One morning, as he had
his face turned homeward, after a long stroll, he heard behind him the sound of
a horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and, looking back, perceived a gentleman, who would
presently pass him, advancing up the road which led to the lodge-gates of
Medley. He went his way, and, as the horse overtook him, noticed that the rider
slackened pace. Then he turned again, and recognised in this personage his
brilliant occasional friend Captain Sholto. The Captain pulled up alongside of
him, saluting him with a smile and a movement of the whip-handle. Hyacinth
stared with surprise, not having heard from the Princess that she was expecting
him. He gathered, however, in a moment, that she was not; and meanwhile he
received an impression, on Sholto&rsquo;s part, of riding-gear that was
&lsquo;knowing&rsquo;&mdash;of gaiters and spurs and a curious waistcoat;
perceiving that this was a phase of the Captain&rsquo;s varied nature which he
had not yet had an opportunity to observe. He struck him as very high in the
air, perched on his big, lean chestnut, and Hyacinth noticed that if the horse
was heated the rider was cool.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning, my dear fellow. I thought I should find you here!&rdquo;
the Captain exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good job I&rsquo;ve met you this
way, without having to go to the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who gave you reason to think I was here?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked; partly
occupied with the appositeness of this inquiry and partly thinking, as his eyes
wandered over his handsome friend, bestriding so handsome a beast, what a jolly
thing it would be to know how to ride. He had already, during the few days he
had been at Medley, had time to observe that the knowledge of luxury and the
extension of one&rsquo;s sensations beget a taste for still newer pleasures.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I knew the Princess was capable of asking you,&rdquo; Sholto said;
&ldquo;and I learned at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo; that you had not been
there for a long time. I knew furthermore that as a general thing you go there
a good deal, don&rsquo;t you? So I put this and that together, and judged you
were out of town.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was very luminous and straightforward, and might have satisfied Hyacinth,
were it not for that irritating reference to the Princess&rsquo;s being
&lsquo;capable of asking him&rsquo;. He knew as well as the Captain that it had
been tremendously eccentric in her to do so, but somehow a transformation had
lately taken place in him which made it disagreeable for him to receive that
view from another, and particularly from a gentleman of whom, on a certain
occasion, several months before, he had had strong grounds for thinking
unfavourably. He had not seen Sholto since the evening when a queer combination
of circumstances caused him, more queerly still, to sit and listen to comic
songs in the company of Millicent Henning and this admirer. The Captain did not
conceal his admiration; Hyacinth had his own ideas about his taking that line
in order to look more innocent. That evening, when he accompanied Millicent to
her lodgings (they parted with Sholto on coming out of the Pavilion), the
situation was tense between the young lady and her childhood&rsquo;s friend.
She let him have it, as she said; she gave him a dressing which she evidently
intended should be memorable, for having suspected her, for having insulted her
before a military gentleman. The tone she took, and the magnificent audacity
with which she took it, reduced him to a kind of gratified helplessness; he
watched her at last with something of the excitement with which he would have
watched a clever but uncultivated actress, while she worked herself into a
passion which he believed to be fictitious. He gave more credence to his
jealousy and to the whole air of the case than to her vehement repudiations,
enlivened though these were by tremendous head-tossings and skirt-shakings. But
he felt baffled and outfaced, and took refuge in sarcasms which after all
proved as little as her high gibes; seeking a final solution in one of those
beastly little French shrugs, as Millicent called them, with which she had
already reproached him with interlarding his conversation.
</p>

<p>
The air was never cleared, though the subject of their dispute was afterwards
dropped, Hyacinth promising himself to watch his playmate as he had never done
before. She let him know, as may well be supposed, that she had her eye on
<i>him</i>, and it must be confessed that as regards the exercise of a right of
supervision he had felt himself at a disadvantage ever since the night at the
theatre. It mattered little that she had pushed him into the Princess&rsquo;s
box (for she herself had not been jealous beforehand; she had wanted too much
to know what such a person could be &lsquo;up to&rsquo;, desiring, perhaps, to
borrow a hint), and it mattered little, also, that his relations with the great
lady were all for the sake of suffering humanity; the atmosphere, none the
less, was full of thunder for many weeks, and it scarcely signified from which
quarter the flash and the explosion proceeded. Hyacinth was a good deal
surprised to find that he should care whether Millicent deceived him or not,
and even tried to persuade himself that he didn&rsquo;t; but there was a grain
of conviction in his heart that some kind of personal affinity existed between
them and that it would torment him more never to see her at all than to see her
go into tantrums in order to cover her tracks. An inner sense told him that her
mingled beauty and grossness, her vulgar vitality, the spirit of contradiction
yet at the same time of attachment that was in her, had ended by making her
indispensable to him. She bored him as much as she irritated him; but if she
was full of execrable taste she was also full of life, and her rustlings and
chatterings, her wonderful stories, her bad grammar and good health, her
insatiable thirst, her shrewd perceptions and grotesque opinions, her mistakes
and her felicities, were now all part of the familiar human sound of his little
world. He could say to himself that she came after him much more than he went
after her, and this helped him, a little, to believe, though the logic was but
lame, that she was not making a fool of him. If she were really taking up with
a swell he didn&rsquo;t see why she wished to retain a bookbinder. Of late, it
must be added, he had ceased to devote much consideration to Millicent&rsquo;s
ambiguities; for although he was lingering on at Medley for the sake of
suffering humanity he was quite aware that to say so (if she should ask him for
a reason) would have almost as absurd a sound as some of the girl&rsquo;s own
speeches. As regards Sholto, he was in the awkward position of having let him
off, as it were, by accepting his hospitality, his bounty; so that he
couldn&rsquo;t quarrel with him except on a fresh pretext. This pretext the
Captain had apparently been careful not to give, and Millicent had told him,
after the triple encounter in the street, that he had driven him out of
England, the poor gentleman whom he insulted by his low insinuations even more
(why &lsquo;even more&rsquo; Hyacinth hardly could think) than he outraged
herself. When he asked her what she knew about the Captain&rsquo;s movements
she made no scruple to announce to him that the latter had come to her great
shop to make a little purchase (it was a pair of silk braces, if she remembered
rightly, and she admitted, perfectly, the transparency of the pretext), and had
asked her with much concern whether his gifted young friend (that&rsquo;s what
he called him&mdash;Hyacinth could see he meant well) was still in a huff.
Millicent had answered that she was afraid he was&mdash;the more shame to him;
and then the Captain had said that it didn&rsquo;t matter, for he himself was
on the point of leaving England for several weeks (Hyacinth&mdash;he called him
Hyacinth this time&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t have ideas about a man in a foreign
country, could he?), and he hoped that by the time he returned the little cloud
would have blown over. Sholto had added that she had better tell him
frankly&mdash;recommending her at the same time to be gentle with their morbid
friend&mdash;about his visit to the shop. Their candour, their humane
precautions, were all very well; but after this, two or three evenings,
Hyacinth passed and repassed the Captain&rsquo;s chambers in Queen Anne Street,
to see if, at the window, there were signs of his being in London. Darkness,
however, prevailed, and he was forced to comfort himself a little when, at last
making up his mind to ring at the door and inquire, by way of a test, for the
occupant, he was informed, by the superior valet whose acquaintance he had
already made, and whose air of wearing a jacket left behind by his master
confirmed the statement, that the gentleman in question was at Monte Carlo.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you still got your back up a little?&rdquo; the Captain demanded,
without rancour; and in a moment he had swung a long leg over the saddle and
dismounted, walking beside his young friend and leading his horse by the
bridle. Hyacinth pretended not to know what he meant, for it came over him that
after all, even if he had not condoned, at the time, the Captain&rsquo;s
suspected treachery, he was in no position, sitting at the feet of the
Princess, to sound the note of jealousy in relation to another woman. He
reflected that the Princess had originally been, in a manner, Sholto&rsquo;s
property, and if he did <i>en fin de compte</i> wish to quarrel with him about
Millicent he would have to cease to appear to poach on the Captain&rsquo;s
preserves. It now occurred to him, for the first time, that the latter had
intended a kind of exchange; though it must be added that the Princess, who on
a couple of occasions had alluded slightingly to her military friend, had given
him no sign of recognising this gentleman&rsquo;s claim. Sholto let him know,
at present, that he was staying at Bonchester, seven miles off; he had come
down from London and put up at the inn. That morning he had ridden over on a
hired horse (Hyacinth had supposed this steed was a very fine animal, but
Sholto spoke of it as an infernal screw); he had been taken by the sudden fancy
of seeing how his young friend was coming on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming on very well, thank you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, with
some shortness, not knowing exactly what business it was of the
Captain&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you understand my interest in you, don&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m
responsible for you&mdash;I put you forward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are a great many things in the world that I don&rsquo;t
understand, but I think the thing I understand least is your interest in me.
Why the devil&mdash;&rdquo; And Hyacinth paused, breathless with the force of
his inquiry. Then he went on, &ldquo;If I were you, I shouldn&rsquo;t care a
filbert for the sort of person that I happen to be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That proves how different my nature is from yours! But I don&rsquo;t
believe it, my boy; you are too generous for that.&rdquo; Sholto&rsquo;s
imperturbability always appeared to grow with the irritation it produced, and
it was proof even against the just resentment excited by his want of tact. That
want of tact was sufficiently marked when he went on to say, &ldquo;I wanted to
see you here, with my own eyes. I wanted to see how it looked; it <i>is</i> a
rum sight! Of course you know what I mean, though you are always trying to make
a fellow explain. I don&rsquo;t explain well, in any sense, and that&rsquo;s
why I go in only for clever people, who can do without it. It&rsquo;s very
grand, her having brought you down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grand, no doubt, but hardly surprising, considering that, as you say, I
was put forward by you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a great thing for me, but it doesn&rsquo;t make any
difference to her!&rdquo; Sholto exclaimed. &ldquo;She may care for certain
things for themselves, but it will never signify a jot to her what I may have
thought about them. One good turn deserves another. I wish you would put
<i>me</i> forward!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, and I don&rsquo;t think I want to,&rdquo;
said Hyacinth, as his companion strolled beside him.
</p>

<p>
The latter put a hand on his arm, stopping him, and they stood face to face a
moment. &ldquo;I say, my dear Robinson, you&rsquo;re not spoiled already, at
the end of a week&mdash;how long is it? It isn&rsquo;t possible you&rsquo;re
jealous!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jealous of whom?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, whose failure to comprehend was
perfectly genuine.
</p>

<p>
Sholto looked at him a moment; then, with a laugh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean
Miss Henning.&rdquo; Hyacinth turned away, and the Captain resumed his walk,
now taking the young man&rsquo;s arm and passing his own through the bridle of
the horse. &ldquo;The courage of it, the insolence, the <i>crânerie!</i> There
isn&rsquo;t another woman in Europe who could carry it off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was silent a little; after which he remarked, &ldquo;This is nothing,
here. You should have seen me the other day over at Broome, at Lady
Marchant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gad, did she take you there? I&rsquo;d have given ten pounds to see it.
There&rsquo;s no one like her!&rdquo; cried the Captain, gaily,
enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one like me, I think&mdash;for going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you enjoy it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too much&mdash;too much. Such excesses are dangerous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll back you,&rdquo; said the Captain; then, checking their
pace, he inquired, &ldquo;Is there any chance of our meeting her? I won&rsquo;t
go into the park.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go to the house?&rdquo; Hyacinth demanded, staring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, no, not while you&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I shall ask the Princess about you, and have done with it, once
for all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucky little beggar, with your fireside talks!&rdquo; the Captain
exclaimed. &ldquo;Where does she sit now, in the evening? She won&rsquo;t tell
you anything except that I&rsquo;m a nuisance; but even if she were willing to
take the trouble to throw some light upon me it wouldn&rsquo;t be of much use,
because she doesn&rsquo;t understand me herself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are the only thing in the world then of which that can be
said,&rdquo; Hyacinth returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say I am, and I am rather proud of it. So far as the head is
concerned, the Princess is all there. I told you, when I presented you, that
she was the cleverest woman in Europe, and that is still my opinion. But there
are some mysteries you can&rsquo;t see into unless you happen to have a little
heart. The Princess hasn&rsquo;t, though doubtless just now you think
that&rsquo;s her strong point. One of these days you&rsquo;ll see. I
don&rsquo;t care a straw, myself, whether she has or not. She has hurt me
already so much she can&rsquo;t hurt me any more, and my interest in her is
quite independent of that. To watch her, to adore her, to see her lead her life
and act out her extraordinary nature, all the while she treats me like a brute,
is the only thing I care for to-day. It doesn&rsquo;t do me a scrap of good,
but, all the same, it&rsquo;s my principal occupation. You may believe me or
not&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t in the least matter; but I&rsquo;m the most
disinterested human being alive. She&rsquo;ll tell you I&rsquo;m a tremendous
ass, and so one is. But that isn&rsquo;t all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was Hyacinth who stopped this time, arrested by something new and natural in
the tone of his companion, a simplicity of emotion which he had not hitherto
associated with him. He stood there a moment looking up at him, and thinking
again what improbable confidences it decidedly appeared to be his lot to
receive from gentlefolks. To what quality in himself were they a tribute? The
honour was one he could easily dispense with; though as he scrutinised Sholto
he found something in his curious light eyes&mdash;an expression of
cheerfulness not disconnected from veracity&mdash;which put him into a less
fantastic relation with this jaunty, factitious personage. &ldquo;Please go
on,&rdquo; he said, in a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what I mentioned just now is my real and only motive, in anything.
The rest is mere gammon and rubbish, to cover it up&mdash;or to give myself the
change, as the French say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by the rest?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, thinking of
Millicent Henning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, all the straw one chews, to cheat one&rsquo;s appetite; all the rot
one dabbles in, because it may lead to something which it never does lead to;
all the beastly buncombe (you know) that you and I have heard together in
Bloomsbury and that I myself have poured out, damme, with an eloquence worthy
of a better cause. Don&rsquo;t you remember what I have said to you&mdash;all
as my own opinion&mdash;about the impending change of the relations of class
with class? Impending fiddlesticks! I believe those that are on top the heap
are better than those that are under it, that they mean to stay there, and that
if they are not a pack of poltroons they will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care for the social question, then?&rdquo; Hyacinth
inquired, with an aspect of which he was conscious of the blankness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only took it up because she did. It hasn&rsquo;t helped me,&rdquo;
Sholto remarked, smiling. &ldquo;My dear Robinson,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;there is only one thing I care for in life: to have a look at that woman
when I can, and when I can&rsquo;t, to approach her in the sort of way
I&rsquo;m doing now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very curious sort of way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed it is; but if it is good enough for me it ought to be good enough
for you. What I want you to do is this&mdash;to induce her to ask me over to
dine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To induce her&mdash;?&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;m staying at Bonchester and it would be an act of
common humanity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They proceeded till they reached the gates, and in a moment Hyacinth said,
&ldquo;You took up the social question, then, because she did; but do you
happen to know why she took it up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, you must find that out for yourself. I found you the
place, but I can&rsquo;t do your work for you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see. But perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me this: if you had
free access to the Princess a year ago, taking her to the theatre and that sort
of thing, why shouldn&rsquo;t you have it now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This time Sholto&rsquo;s white pupils looked strange again. &ldquo;<i>You</i>
have it now, my dear fellow, but I&rsquo;m afraid it doesn&rsquo;t follow that
you&rsquo;ll have it a year hence. She was tired of me then, and of course
she&rsquo;s still more tired of me now, for the simple reason that I&rsquo;m
more tiresome. She has sent me to Coventry, and I want to come out for a few
hours. See how conscientious I am&mdash;I won&rsquo;t pass the gates.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her I met you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth. Then, irrelevantly,
he added, &ldquo;Is that what you mean by her having no heart?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her treating me as she treats me? Oh, dear, no; her treating you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This had a portentous sound, but it did not prevent Hyacinth from turning round
with his visitor (for it was the greatest part of the oddity of the present
meeting that the hope of a little conversation with him, if accident were
favourable, had been the motive not only of Sholto&rsquo;s riding over to
Medley but of his coming down to stay, in the neighbourhood, at a musty inn in
a dull market-town), it did not prevent him, I say, from bearing the Captain
company for a mile on his backward way. Our young man did not pursue this
particular topic much further, but he discovered still another reason or two
for admiring the light, free action with which his companion had unmasked
himself, and the nature of his interest in the revolutionary idea, after he had
asked him, abruptly, what he had had in his head when he travelled over that
evening, the summer before (he didn&rsquo;t appear to have come back as often
as he promised), to Paul Muniment&rsquo;s place in Camberwell. What was he
looking for, whom was he looking for, there?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was looking for anything that would turn up, that might take her
fancy. Don&rsquo;t you understand that I&rsquo;m always looking? There was a
time when I went in immensely for illuminated missals, and another when I
collected horrible ghost-stories (she wanted to cultivate a belief in ghosts),
all for her. The day I saw she was turning her attention to the rising
democracy I began to collect little democrats. That&rsquo;s how I collected
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Muniment read you exactly, then. And what did you find to your purpose
in Audley Court?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I think the little woman with the popping eyes&mdash;she reminded
me of a bedridden grasshopper&mdash;will do. And I made a note of the other
one, the old virgin with the high nose, the aristocratic sister of mercy.
I&rsquo;m keeping them in reserve for my next propitiatory offering.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was silent a moment. &ldquo;And Muniment himself&mdash;can&rsquo;t you
do anything with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow, after you he&rsquo;s poor!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first stupid thing you have said. But it doesn&rsquo;t
matter, for he dislikes the Princess&mdash;what he knows of her&mdash;too much
ever to consent to see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his line, is it? Then he&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Sholto cried.
</p>

<h3><a name="chap26"></a>XXVI</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he may come, and stay as long as he likes!&rdquo; the Princess
exclaimed, when Hyacinth, that afternoon, told her of his encounter, with the
sweet, bright surprise her face always wore when people went through the form
(supererogatory she apparently meant to declare it) of asking her leave. From
the manner in which she granted Sholto&rsquo;s petition&mdash;with a geniality
that made light of it, as if the question were not worth talking of, one way or
the other&mdash;it might have been supposed that the account he had given
Hyacinth of their relations was an elaborate but none the less foolish hoax.
She sent a messenger with a note over to Bonchester, and the Captain arrived
just in time to dress for dinner. The Princess was always late, and
Hyacinth&rsquo;s toilet, on these occasions, occupied him considerably (he was
acutely conscious of its deficiencies, and yet tried to persuade himself that
they were positively honourable and that the only garb of dignity, for him, was
the costume, as it were, of his profession); therefore, when the fourth member
of the little party descended to the drawing-room Madame Grandoni was the only
person he found there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Santissima Vergine!</i> I&rsquo;m glad to see you! What good wind has
sent you?&rdquo; she exclaimed, as soon as Sholto came into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know I was coming?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Has the idea
of my arrival produced so little agitation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing of the affairs of this house. I have given them up at
last, and it was time. I remain in my room.&rdquo; There was nothing at present
in the old lady&rsquo;s countenance of her usual spirit of cheer; it expressed
anxiety, and even a certain sternness, and the excellent woman had perhaps at
this moment more than she had ever had in her life of the air of a duenna who
took her duties seriously. She looked almost august. &ldquo;From the moment you
come it&rsquo;s a little better. But it is very bad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very bad, dear madam?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you will be able to tell me where Christina <i>veut en
venir</i>. I have always been faithful to her&mdash;I have always been loyal.
But to-day I have lost patience. It has no sense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not sure I know what you are talking about,&rdquo; Sholto said;
&ldquo;but if I understand you I must tell you I think it&rsquo;s
magnificent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know your tone; you are worse than she, because you are cynical.
It passes all bounds. It is very serious. I have been thinking what I should
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely; I know what you would do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, this time I shouldn&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo; the old lady declared.
&ldquo;The scandal is too great; it is intolerable. My only fear is to make it
worse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Madame Grandoni, you can&rsquo;t make it worse, and you can&rsquo;t
make it better,&rdquo; Sholto rejoined, seating himself on the sofa beside her.
&ldquo;In point of fact, no idea of scandal can possibly attach itself to our
friend. She is above and outside of all such considerations, such dangers. She
carries everything off; she heeds so little, she cares so little. Besides, she
has one great strength&mdash;she does no wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray, what do you call it when a lady sends for a bookbinder to come and
live with her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not for a bookbinder as well as for a bishop? It all depends upon
who the lady is, and what she is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She had better take care of one thing first,&rdquo; cried Madame
Grandoni&mdash;&ldquo;that she shall not have been separated from her
husband!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Princess can carry off even that. It&rsquo;s unusual, it&rsquo;s
eccentric, it&rsquo;s fantastic, if you will, but it isn&rsquo;t necessarily
wicked. From her own point of view our friend goes straight. Besides, she has
her opinions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her opinions are perversity itself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does it matter,&rdquo; asked Sholto, &ldquo;if they keep her
quiet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quiet! Do you call this quiet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, if you&rsquo;ll only be so yourself. Putting the case at the
worst, moreover, who is to know he&rsquo;s her bookbinder? It&rsquo;s the last
thing you&rsquo;d take him for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, for that she chose him carefully,&rdquo; the old lady murmured,
still with a discontented eyebrow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>She</i> chose him? It was I who chose him, dear lady!&rdquo; the
Captain exclaimed, with a laugh which showed how little he shared her
solicitude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I had forgotten; at the theatre,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni,
gazing at him as if her ideas were confused but a certain repulsion from her
interlocutor nevertheless disengaged itself. &ldquo;It was a fine turn you did
him there, poor young man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, he will have to be sacrificed. But why was I bound to
consider him so much? Haven&rsquo;t I been sacrificed myself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if he bears it like you!&rdquo; cried the old lady, with a short
laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know how I bear it? One does what one can,&rdquo; said the
Captain, settling his shirt-front. &ldquo;At any rate, remember this: she
won&rsquo;t tell people who he is, for his own sake; and he won&rsquo;t tell
them, for hers. So, as he looks much more like a poet, or a pianist, or a
painter, there won&rsquo;t be that sensation you fear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even so it&rsquo;s bad enough,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni. &ldquo;And
he&rsquo;s capable of bringing it out, suddenly, himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, if he doesn&rsquo;t mind it, she won&rsquo;t! But that&rsquo;s his
affair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too terrible, to spoil him for his station,&rdquo; the old
lady went on. &ldquo;How can he ever go back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you want him kept, then, indefinitely, you are inconsistent. Besides,
if he pays for it, he deserves to pay. He&rsquo;s an abominable little
conspirator against society.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni was silent a moment; then she looked at the Captain with a
gravity which might have been impressive to him, had not his accomplished
jauntiness suggested an insensibility to that sort of influence. &ldquo;What,
then, does Christina deserve?&rdquo; she asked, with solemnity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever she may get; whatever, in the future, may make her suffer. But
it won&rsquo;t be the loss of her reputation. She is too distinguished.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You English are strange. Is it because she&rsquo;s a princess?&rdquo;
Madame Grandoni reflected, audibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, no, her princedom is nothing here. We can easily beat that.
But we can&rsquo;t beat&mdash;&rdquo; And Sholto paused a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; his companion asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, the perfection of her indifference to public opinion and the
unaffectedness of her originality; the sort of thing by which she has bedeviled
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>you!</i>&rdquo; murmured Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you think so poorly of me why did you say just now that you were glad
to see me?&rdquo; Sholto demanded, in a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you make another person in the house, and that is more regular;
the situation is by so much less&mdash;what did you call it?&mdash;eccentric.
<i>Nun</i>,&rdquo; the old lady went on, in a moment, &ldquo;so long as you are
here I won&rsquo;t go off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Depend upon it that I shall be here until I&rsquo;m turned out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She rested her small, troubled eyes upon him, but they betrayed no particular
enthusiasm at this announcement, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how, for
yourself, on such an occasion, you should like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Madame Grandoni, the heart of man, without being such a hopeless
labyrinth as the heart of woman, is still sufficiently complicated. Don&rsquo;t
I know what will become of the little beggar?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very horrible,&rdquo; said the ancient woman. Then she added, in
a different tone, &ldquo;He is much too good for his fate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray wasn&rsquo;t I, for mine?&rdquo; the Captain asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By no manner of means!&rdquo; Madame Grandoni answered, rising and
moving away from him.
</p>

<p>
The Princess had come into the room, accompanied by Hyacinth. As it was now
considerably past the dinner-hour the old lady judged that this couple, on
their side, had met in the hall and had prolonged their conversation there.
Hyacinth watched with extreme interest the way the Princess greeted the
Captain&mdash;observed that it was very simple, easy and friendly. At dinner
she made no stranger of him, including him in everything, as if he had been a
useful familiar, like Madame Grandoni, only a little less venerable, yet not
giving him any attention that might cause their eyes to meet. She had told
Hyacinth that she didn&rsquo;t like his eyes, nor indeed, very much, any part
of him. Of course any admiration, from almost any source, could not fail to be
in some degree agreeable to a woman, but of any little impression that one
might ever have produced the mark she had made on Godfrey Sholto was the one
that ministered least to her vanity. He had been useful, undoubtedly, at times,
but at others he had been an intolerable bore. He was so uninteresting in
himself, so shallow, so unoccupied and superfluous, and really so frivolous, in
spite of his pretension (of which she was unspeakably weary) of being all
wrapped up in a single idea. It had never, by itself, been sufficient to
interest her in any man, the fact that he was in love with her; but indeed she
could honestly say that most of the people who had liked her had had, on their
own side, something&mdash;something in their character or
circumstances&mdash;that one could care a little about. Not so far as would do
any harm, save perhaps in one or two cases; but still, something.
</p>

<p>
Sholto was a curious and not particularly edifying English type (as the
Princess further described him); one of those strange beings produced by old
societies that have run to seed, corrupt, exhausted civilisations. He was a
cumberer of the earth, and purely selfish, in spite of his devoted,
disinterested airs. He was nothing whatever in himself, and had no character or
merit save by tradition, reflection, imitation, superstition. He had a longish
pedigree&mdash;he came of some musty, mouldy &lsquo;county family&rsquo;,
people with a local reputation and an immense lack of general importance; he
had taken the greatest care of his little fortune. He had travelled all over
the globe several times, &lsquo;for the shooting&rsquo;, in that brutal way of
the English. That was a pursuit which was compatible with the greatest
stupidity. He had a little taste, a little cleverness, a little reading, a
little good furniture, a little French and Italian (he exaggerated these latter
quantities), an immense deal of assurance, and complete leisure. That, at
bottom, was all he represented&mdash;idle, trifling, luxurious, yet at the same
time pretentious leisure, the sort of thing that led people to invent false,
humbugging duties, because they had no real ones. Sholto&rsquo;s great idea of
himself (after his profession of being her slave) was that he was a
cosmopolite&mdash;exempt from every prejudice. About the prejudices the
Princess couldn&rsquo;t say and didn&rsquo;t care; but she had seen him in
foreign countries, she had seen him in Italy, and she was bound to say he
understood nothing about those people. It was several years before, shortly
after her marriage, that she had first encountered him. He had not begun
immediately to take the adoring line, but it had come little by little. It was
only after she had separated from her husband that he had begun really to hang
about her; since when she had suffered much from him. She would do him one
justice, however: he had never, so far as she knew, had the impudence to
represent himself as anything but hopeless and helpless. It was on this that he
took his stand; he wished to pass for the great model of unrewarded constancy.
She couldn&rsquo;t imagine what he was waiting for; perhaps it was for the
death of the Prince. But the Prince would never die, nor had she the least
desire that he should. She had no wish to be harsh, for of course that sort of
thing, from any one, was very flattering; but really, whatever feeling poor
Sholto might have, four-fifths of it were purely theatrical. He was not in the
least a natural human being, but had a hundred affectations and attitudes, the
result of never having been obliged to put his hand to anything; having no
serious tastes and yet being born to a little &lsquo;position&rsquo;. The
Princess remarked that she was so glad Hyacinth had no position, and had been
forced to do something in life but amuse himself; that was the way she liked
her friends now. She had said to Sholto again and again, &ldquo;There are
plenty of others who will be much more pleased; why not go to <i>them?</i>
It&rsquo;s such a waste of time:&rdquo; and she was sure he had taken her
advice, and was by no means, as regards herself, the absorbed, annihilated
creature he endeavoured to appear. He had told her once that he tried to take
an interest in other women&mdash;though indeed he had added that it was of no
use. Of what use did he expect anything he could possibly do to be? Hyacinth
did not tell the Princess that he had reason to believe the Captain&rsquo;s
effort in this direction had not been absolutely vain; but he made that
reflection, privately, with increased confidence. He recognised a further truth
even when his companion said, at the end, that, with all she had touched upon,
he was a queer combination. Trifler as he was, there was something sinister in
him too; and she confessed she had had a vague feeling, at times, that some day
he might do her a hurt. Hyacinth, at this, stopped short, on the threshold of
the drawing-room, and asked in a low voice, &ldquo;Are you afraid of
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess looked at him a moment; then smiling, &ldquo;<i>Dio mio</i>, how
you say that! Should you like to kill him for me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall have to kill some one, you know. Why not him, while I&rsquo;m
about it, if he troubles you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my friend, if you should begin to kill every one who had troubled
me!&rdquo; the Princess murmured, as they went into the room.

<p>
Hyacinth knew there was something out of the way as soon as he saw Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s face look forth at him, in answer to his tap, while she held the
door ajar. What was she doing in Pinnie&rsquo;s bedroom?&mdash;a very poor
place, into which the dressmaker, with her reverence, would never have admitted
a person of that quality unless things were pretty bad. She was solemn, too;
she didn&rsquo;t laugh, as usual; she had removed her large hat, with its limp,
old-fashioned veil, and she raised her finger to her lips. Hyacinth&rsquo;s
first alarm had been immediately after he let himself into the house, with his
latch-key, as he always did, and found the little room on the right of the
passage, in which Pinnie had lived ever since he remembered, fireless and
untenanted. As soon as he had paid the cabman, who put down his portmanteau for
him in the hall (he was not used to paying cabmen, and was conscious he gave
him too much, but was too impatient, in his sudden anxiety, to care), he
hurried up the vile staircase, which seemed viler, even through his
preoccupation, than ever, and gave the knock, accompanied by a call the least
bit tremulous, immediately answered by Lady Aurora. She drew back into the room
a moment, while he stared, in his dismay; then she emerged again, closing the
door behind her&mdash;all with the air of enjoining him to be terribly quiet.
He felt, suddenly, so sick at the idea of having lingered at Medley while there
was distress at the wretched little house to which he owed so much, that he
scarcely found strength for an articulate question, and obeyed, mechanically,
the mute, urgent gesture by which Lady Aurora appealed to him to go downstairs
with her. It was only when they stood together in the deserted parlour (it was
as if he perceived for the first time what an inelegant odour prevailed there)
that he asked, &ldquo;Is she dying&mdash;is she dead?&rdquo; That was the least
the strained sadness looking out from the face of the noble visitor appeared to
announce.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Mr Robinson, I&rsquo;m so sorry for you. I wanted to write, but I
promised her I wouldn&rsquo;t. She is very ill&mdash;we are very anxious. It
began ten days ago, and I suppose I <i>must</i> tell you how much she has gone
down.&rdquo; Lady Aurora spoke with more than all her usual embarrassments and
precautions, eagerly, yet as if it cost her much pain: pausing a little after
everything she said, to see how he would take it; then going on, with a little
propitiatory rush. He learned presently what was the matter, what doctor she
had sent for, and that if he would wait a little before going into the room it
would be so much better; the invalid having sunk, within half an hour, into a
doze of a less agitated kind than she had had for some time, from which it
would be an immense pity to run the risk of waking her. The doctor gave her the
right things, as it seemed to her ladyship, but he admitted that she had very
little power of resistance. He was of course not a very large practitioner, Mr
Buffery, from round the corner, but he seemed really clever; and she herself
had taken the liberty (as she confessed to this she threw off one of her odd
laughs, and her colour rose) of sending an elderly, respectable person&mdash;a
kind of nurse. She was out just then; she had to go, for an hour, for the
air&mdash;&ldquo;only when I come, of course,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora. Dear
Miss Pynsent had had a cold hanging about her, and had not taken care of it.
Hyacinth would know how plucky she was about that sort of thing; she took so
little interest in herself. &ldquo;Of course a cold is a cold, whoever has it;
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Lady Aurora. Ten days before, she had taken an
additional chill through falling asleep in her chair, in the evening, down
there, and letting the fire go out. &ldquo;It would have been nothing if she
had been like you or me, you know,&rdquo; her ladyship went on; &ldquo;but just
as she was then, it made the difference. The day was horribly damp, and it had
struck into the lungs, and inflammation had set in. Mr Buffery says she was
impoverished, just rather low and languid, you know.&rdquo; The next morning
she had bad pains and a good deal of fever, yet she had got up. Poor
Pinnie&rsquo;s gracious ministrant did not make clear to Hyacinth what time had
elapsed before she came to her relief, nor by what means she had been notified,
and he saw that she slurred this over from the admirable motive of wishing him
not to feel that the little dressmaker had suffered by his absence or called
for him in vain. This, apparently, had indeed not been the case, if Pinnie had
opposed, successfully, his being written to. Lady Aurora only said, &ldquo;I
came in very soon, it was such a delightful chance. Since then she has had
everything; only it&rsquo;s sad to see a person <i>need</i> so little. She did
want you to stay; she has clung to that idea. I speak the simple truth, Mr
Robinson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to you&mdash;you are so extraordinarily
good, so angelic,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied, bewildered and made weak by a
strange, unexpected shame. The episode he had just traversed, the splendour he
had been living in and drinking so deep of, the unnatural alliance to which he
had given himself up while his wretched little foster-mother struggled alone
with her death-stroke&mdash;he could see it was that; the presentiment of it,
the last stiff horror, was in all the place&mdash;the contrast seemed to cut
him like a knife, and to make the horrible accident of his absence a perversity
of his own. &ldquo;I can never blame you, when you are so kind, but I wish to
God I had known!&rdquo; he broke out.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora clasped her hands, begging him to judge her fairly. &ldquo;Of
course it was a great responsibility for us, but we thought it right to
consider what she urged upon us. She went back to it constantly, that your
visit should <i>not</i> be cut short. When you should come of yourself, it
would be time enough. I don&rsquo;t know exactly where you have been, but she
said it was such a pleasant house. She kept repeating that it would do you so
much good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth felt his eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
dying&mdash;she&rsquo;s dying! How can she live when she&rsquo;s like
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sank upon the old yellow sofa, the sofa of his lifetime and of so many years
before, and buried his head on the shabby, tattered arm. A succession of sobs
broke from his lips&mdash;sobs in which the accumulated emotion of months and
the strange, acute conflict of feeling that had possessed him for the three
weeks just past found relief and a kind of solution. Lady Aurora sat down
beside him and laid her finger-tips gently on his hand. So, for a minute, while
his tears flowed and she said nothing, he felt her timid, consoling touch. At
the end of the minute he raised his head; it came back to him that she had said
&lsquo;we&rsquo; just before, and he asked her whom she meant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr Vetch, don&rsquo;t you know? I have made his acquaintance;
it&rsquo;s impossible to be more kind.&rdquo; Then, while, for an instant,
Hyacinth was silent, wincing, pricked with the thought that Pinnie had been
beholden to the fiddler while <i>he</i> was masquerading in high life, Lady
Aurora added, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a charming musician. She asked him once, at
first, to bring his violin; she thought it would soothe her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to him, but now that I&rsquo;m here we
needn&rsquo;t trouble him,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
Apparently there was a certain dryness in his tone, which was the cause of her
ladyship&rsquo;s venturing to reply, after an hesitation, &ldquo;Do let him
come, Mr Robinson; let him be near you! I wonder whether you know
that&mdash;that he has a great affection for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The more fool he; I have always treated him like a brute!&rdquo;
Hyacinth exclaimed, colouring.
</p>

<p>
The way Lady Aurora spoke proved to him, later, that she now definitely did
know his secret, or one of them, rather; for at the rate things had been going
for the last few months he was making a regular collection. She knew the
smaller&mdash;not, of course, the greater; she had, decidedly, been illuminated
by Pinnie&rsquo;s divagations. At the moment he made that reflection, however,
he was almost startled to perceive how completely he had ceased to resent such
betrayals and how little it suddenly seemed to signify that the innocent source
of them was about to be quenched. The sense of his larger secret swallowed up
that particular anxiety, making him ask himself what it mattered, for the time
that was left to him, that people should whisper to each other his little
mystery. The day came quickly when he believed, and yet didn&rsquo;t care, that
it had been universally imparted.
</p>

<p>
After Lady Aurora left him, promising she would call him the first moment it
should seem prudent, he walked up and down the cold, stale parlour, immersed in
his meditations. The shock of the danger of losing Pinnie had already passed
away; he had achieved so much, of late, in the line of accepting the idea of
death that the little dressmaker, in taking her departure, seemed already to
benefit by this curious discipline. What was most vivid to him, in the deserted
scene of Pinnie&rsquo;s unsuccessful industry, was the changed vision with
which he had come back to objects familiar for twenty years. The picture was
the same, and all its horrid elements, wearing a kind of greasy gloss in the
impure air of Lomax Place, made, through the mean window-panes, a dismal
<i>chiaroscuro</i>&mdash;showed, in their polished misery, the friction of his
own little life; but the eyes with which he looked at it had new terms of
comparison. He had known the place was hideous and sordid, but its aspect
to-day was pitiful to the verge of the sickening; he couldn&rsquo;t believe
that for years together he had accepted and even, a little, revered it. He was
frightened at the sort of service that his experience of grandeur had rendered
him. It was all very well to have assimilated that element with a rapidity
which had surprises even for himself; but with sensibilities now so improved
what fresh arrangement could one come to with the very humble, which was in its
nature uncompromising? Though the spring was far advanced the day was a dark
drizzle, and the room had the clamminess of a finished use, an ooze of dampness
from the muddy street, where the areas were a narrow slit. No wonder Pinnie had
felt it at last, and her small under-fed organism had grown numb and ceased to
act. At the thought of her limited, stinted life, the patient, humdrum effort
of her needle and scissors, which had ended only in a show-room where there was
nothing to show and a pensive reference to the cut of sleeves no longer worn,
the tears again rose to his eyes; but he brushed them aside when he heard a
cautious tinkle at the house-door, which was presently opened by the little
besmirched slavey retained for the service of the solitary lodger&mdash;a
domestic easily bewildered, who had a squint and distressed Hyacinth by wearing
shoes that didn&rsquo;t match, though they were of an equal antiquity and
resembled each other in the facility with which they dropped off. Hyacinth had
not heard Mr Vetch&rsquo;s voice in the hall, apparently because he spoke in a
whisper; but the young man was not surprised when, taking every precaution not
to make the door creak, he came into the parlour. The fiddler said nothing to
him at first; the two men only looked at each other for a long minute. Hyacinth
saw what he most wanted to know&mdash;whether <i>he</i> knew the worst about
Pinnie; but what was further in his eyes (they had an expression considerably
different from any he had hitherto seen in them) defined itself to our hero
only little by little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you might have written me a word?&rdquo; said
Hyacinth, at last. His anger at having been left in ignorance had quitted him,
but he thought the question fair. None the less, he expected a sarcastic
answer, and was surprised at the mild reasonableness with which Mr Vetch
replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure you, no responsibility, in the course of my life, ever did more
to distress me. There were obvious reasons for calling you back, and yet I
couldn&rsquo;t help wishing you might finish your visit. I balanced one thing
against the other; it was very difficult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can imagine nothing more simple. When people&rsquo;s nearest and
dearest are dying, they are usually sent for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler gave a strange, argumentative smile. If Lomax Place and Miss
Pynsent&rsquo;s select lodging-house wore a new face of vulgarity to Hyacinth,
it may be imagined whether the renunciation of the niceties of the toilet, the
resigned seediness, which marked Mr Vetch&rsquo;s old age was unlikely to lend
itself to comparison. The glossy butler at Medley had had a hundred more of the
signs of success in life. &ldquo;My dear boy, this case was exceptional,&rdquo;
said the old man. &ldquo;Your visit had a character of importance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you know about it. I don&rsquo;t remember that I
told you anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, certainly, you have never told me much. But if, as is probable, you
have seen that kind lady who is now upstairs, you will have learned that Pinnie
made a tremendous point of your not being disturbed. She threatened us with her
displeasure if we should hurry you back. You know what Pinnie&rsquo;s
displeasure is!&rdquo; As, at this, Hyacinth turned away with a gesture of
irritation, Mr Vetch went on, &ldquo;No doubt she is absurdly fanciful, poor
dear thing; but don&rsquo;t, now, cast any disrespect upon it. I assure you, if
she had been here alone, suffering, sinking, without a creature to tend her,
and nothing before her but to die in a corner, like a starved cat, she would
still have faced that fate rather than cut short by a single hour your
experience of novel scenes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Of course I know what you mean. But
she spun her delusion&mdash;she always did, all of them&mdash;out of nothing. I
can&rsquo;t imagine what she knows about my &lsquo;experience&rsquo; of any
kind of scenes. I told her, when I went out of town, very little more than I
told you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What she guessed, what she gathered, has been, at any rate, enough. She
has made up her mind that you have formed a connection by means of which you
will come, somehow or other, into your own. She has done nothing but talk about
your grand kindred. To her mind, you know, it&rsquo;s all one, the aristocracy,
and nothing is simpler than that the person&mdash;very exalted, as she
believes&mdash;with whom you have been to stay should undertake your business
with her friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad not to have
deprived you of that entertainment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I assure you the spectacle was exquisite.&rdquo; Then the fiddler added,
&ldquo;My dear fellow, please leave her the idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave it? I&rsquo;ll do much more!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her my great relations have adopted me and that I have
come back in the character of Lord Robinson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will need nothing more to die happy,&rdquo; Mr Vetch observed.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, after Hyacinth had obtained from his old friend a
confirmation of Lady Aurora&rsquo;s account of Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s condition,
Mr Vetch explaining that he came over, like that, to see how she was, half a
dozen times a day&mdash;five minutes later a silence had descended upon the
pair, while Hyacinth waited for some sign from Lady Aurora that he might come
upstairs. The fiddler, who had lighted a pipe, looked out of the window,
studying intently the physiognomy of Lomax Place; and Hyacinth, making his
tread discreet, walked about the room with his hands in his pockets. At last Mr
Vetch observed, without taking his pipe out of his lips or looking round,
&ldquo;I think you might be a little more frank with me at this time of day and
at such a crisis.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stopped in his walk, wondering for a moment, sincerely, what his
companion meant, for he had no consciousness at present of an effort to conceal
anything he could possibly tell (there were some things, of course, he
couldn&rsquo;t); on the contrary, his life seemed to him particularly open to
the public view and exposed to invidious comment. It was at this moment he
first observed a certain difference; there was a tone in Mr Vetch&rsquo;s voice
that he had never perceived before&mdash;an absence of that note which had made
him say, in other days, that the impenetrable old man was diverting himself at
his expense. It was as if his attitude had changed, become more explicitly
considerate, in consequence of some alteration or promotion on Hyacinth&rsquo;s
part, his having grown older, or more important, or even simply more
surpassingly curious. If the first impression made upon him by Pinnie&rsquo;s
old neighbour, as to whose place in the list of the sacrificial (his being a
gentleman or one of the sovereign people) he formerly was so perplexed; if the
sentiment excited by Mr Vetch in a mind familiar now for nearly a month with
forms of indubitable gentility was not favourable to the idea of
fraternisation, this secret impatience on Hyacinth&rsquo;s part was speedily
corrected by one of the sudden reactions or quick conversions of which the
young man was so often the victim. In the light of the fiddler&rsquo;s appeal,
which evidently meant more than it said, his musty antiquity, his typical look
of having had, for years, a small, definite use and taken all the creases and
contractions of it, his visible expression, even, of ultimate parsimony and of
having ceased to care for the shape of his trousers because he cared more for
something else&mdash;these things became so many reasons for turning round,
going over to him, touching signs of an invincible fidelity, the humble,
continuous, single-minded practice of daily duties and an art after all very
charming; pursued, moreover, while persons of the species our restored prodigal
had lately been consorting with fidgeted from one selfish sensation to another
and couldn&rsquo;t even live in the same place for three months together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What should you like me to do, to say, to tell you? Do you want to know
what I have been doing in the country? I should have first to know,
myself,&rdquo; Hyacinth said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you enjoyed it very much?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, certainly, very much&mdash;not knowing anything about Pinnie. I
have been in a beautiful house, with a beautiful woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch had turned round; he looked very impartial, through the smoke of his
pipe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she really a princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by &lsquo;really&rsquo;. I suppose all
titles are great rot. But every one seems agreed to call her so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I have always liked to enter into your life; and to-day the
wish is stronger than ever,&rdquo; the old man observed, presently, fixing his
eyes very steadily on Hyacinth&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
The latter returned his gaze for a moment; then he asked, &ldquo;What makes you
say that just now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler appeared to deliberate, and at last he replied, &ldquo;Because you
are in danger of losing the best friend you have ever had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be sure I feel it. But if I have got you&mdash;&rdquo; Hyacinth added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, me! I&rsquo;m very old, and very tired of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that that&rsquo;s what one arrives at. Well, if I can help you
in any way you must lean on me, you must make use of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely what I was going to say to you,&rdquo; said Mr
Vetch. &ldquo;Should you like any money?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I should! But why should you offer it to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because in saving it up, little by little, I have had you in
mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Mr Vetch,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, &ldquo;you have me too much in
mind. I&rsquo;m not worth it, please believe that; for all sorts of reasons. I
should make money enough for any uses I have for it, or have any right to have,
if I stayed quietly in London and attended to my work. As you know, I can earn
a decent living.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I can see that. But if you stayed quietly in London what would
become of your princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, they can always manage, ladies in that position.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hanged if I understand her position!&rdquo; cried Mr Vetch, but without
laughing. &ldquo;You have been for three weeks without work, and yet you look
uncommonly smart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, my living has cost me nothing. When you stay with great people
you don&rsquo;t pay your score,&rdquo; Hyacinth explained, with great
gentleness. &ldquo;Moreover, the lady whose hospitality I have been enjoying
has made me a very handsome offer of work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What kind of work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only kind I know. She is going to send me a lot of books, to do up
for her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to pay you fancy prices?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no; I am to fix the prices myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are not transactions of that kind rather disagreeable, with a lady whose
hospitality one has been enjoying?&rdquo; Mr Vetch inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exceedingly! That is exactly why I shall do the books and then take no
money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your princess is rather clever!&rdquo; the fiddler exclaimed, in a
moment, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t force me to take it if I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; you must only let <i>me</i> do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have curious ideas about me,&rdquo; the young man declared.
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch turned about to the window again, remarking that he had curious ideas
about everything. Then he added, after an interval&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And have you been making love to your great lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had expected a flash of impatience in reply to this inquiry, and was rather
surprised at the manner in which Hyacinth answered: &ldquo;How shall I explain?
It is not a question of that sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has she been making love to you, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you should ever see her you would understand how absurd that
supposition is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How shall I ever see her?&rdquo; returned Mr Vetch. &ldquo;In the
absence of that privilege I think there is something in my idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She looks quite over my head,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, simply.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s by no means impossible you may see her. She wants to know my
friends, to know the people who live in the Place. And she would take a
particular interest in you, on account of your opinions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I have no opinions now, none any more!&rdquo; the old man broke out,
sadly. &ldquo;I only had them to frighten Pinnie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was easily frightened,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and easily reassured. Well, I like to know about your life,&rdquo;
his neighbour sighed, irrelevantly. &ldquo;But take care the great lady
doesn&rsquo;t lead you too far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, too far?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she an anarchist&mdash;a nihilist? Doesn&rsquo;t she go in
for a general rectification, as Eustace calls it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth was silent a moment. &ldquo;You should see the place&mdash;you should
see what she wears, what she eats and drinks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you mean that she is inconsistent with her theories? My dear boy,
she would be a droll woman if she were not. At any rate, I&rsquo;m glad of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Glad of it?&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For you, I mean, when you stay with her; it&rsquo;s more
luxurious!&rdquo; Mr Vetch exclaimed, turning round and smiling. At this moment
a little rap on the floor above, given by Lady Aurora, announced that Hyacinth
might at last come up and see Pinnie. Mr Vetch listened and recognised it, and
it led him to say, with considerable force, &ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s</i> a woman
whose theories and conduct do square!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth, on the threshold, leaving the room, stopped long enough to reply,
&ldquo;Well, when the day comes for my friend to give up&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have no doubt there are things she will bring herself to
sacrifice,&rdquo; the old man remarked; but Hyacinth was already out of
hearing.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap28"></a>XXVIII</h3>

<p>
Mr Vetch waited below till Lady Aurora should come down and give him the news
he was in suspense for. His mind was pretty well made up about Pinnie. It had
seemed to him, the night before, that death was written in her face, and he
judged it on the whole a very good moment for her to lay down her earthly
burden. He had reasons for believing that the future could not be sweet to her.
As regards Hyacinth, his mind was far from being at ease; for though he was
aware in a general way that he had taken up with strange company, and though he
had flattered himself of old that he should be pleased to see the boy act out
his life and solve the problem of his queer inheritance, he was worried by the
absence of full knowledge. He put out his pipe, in anticipation of Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s reappearance, and without this consoler he was more accessible
still to certain fears that had come to him in consequence of a recent talk, or
rather an attempt at a talk, with Eustache Poupin. It was through the Frenchman
that he had gathered the little he knew about the occasion of Hyacinth&rsquo;s
unprecedented excursion. His ideas on the subject had been very inferential;
for Hyacinth had made a mystery of his absence to Pinnie, merely letting her
know that there was a lady in the case and that the best luggage he could
muster and the best way his shirts could be done up would still not be good
enough. Poupin had seen Godfrey Sholto at the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;, and
it had come to him, through Hyacinth, that there was a remarkable feminine
influence in the Captain&rsquo;s life, mixed up in some way with his presence
in Bloomsbury&mdash;an influence, moreover, by which Hyacinth himself, for good
or for evil, was in peril of being touched. Sholto was the young man&rsquo;s
visible link with a society for which Lisson Grove could have no importance in
the scheme of the universe but as a short cut (too disagreeable to be
frequently used) out of Bayswater; therefore if Hyacinth left town with a new
hat and a pair of kid gloves it must have been to move in the direction of that
superior circle and in some degree, at least, at the solicitation of the
before-mentioned feminine influence. So much as this the Frenchman suggested,
explicitly enough, as his manner was, to the old fiddler; but his talk had a
flavour of other references which excited Mr Vetch&rsquo;s curiosity much more
than they satisfied it. They were obscure; they evidently were painful to the
speaker; they were confused and embarrassed and totally wanting in the
luminosity which usually characterised the lightest allusions of M. Poupin. It
was the fiddler&rsquo;s fancy that his friend had something on his mind which
he was not at liberty to impart, and that it related to Hyacinth and might, for
those who took an interest in the singular lad, constitute a considerable
anxiety. Mr Vetch, on his own part, nursed this anxiety into a tolerably
definite shape: he persuaded himself that the Frenchman had been leading the
boy too far in the line of social criticism, had given him a push on some
crooked path where a slip would be a likely accident. When on a subsequent
occasion, with Poupin, he indulged in a hint of this suspicion, the bookbinder
flushed a good deal and declared that his conscience was pure. It was one of
his peculiarities that when his colour rose he looked angry, and Mr Vetch held
that his displeasure was a proof that in spite of his repudiations he had been
unwise; though before they parted Eustache gave this sign of softness, that he
shed tears of emotion, of which the reason was not clear to the fiddler and
which appeared in a general way to be dedicated to Hyacinth. The interview had
taken place in Lisson Grove, where Madame Poupin, however, had not shown
herself.
</p>

<p>
Altogether the old man was a prey to suppositions which led him to feel how
much he himself had outlived the democratic glow of his prime. He had ended by
accepting everything (though, indeed, he couldn&rsquo;t swallow the idea that a
trick should be played upon Hyacinth), and even by taking an interest in
current politics, as to which, of old, he had held the opinion (the same that
the Poupins held to-day) that they had been invented on purpose to throw dust
in the eyes of disinterested reformers and to circumvent the social solution.
He had given up that problem some time ago; there was no way to clear it up
that didn&rsquo;t seem to make a bigger mess than the actual muddle of human
affairs, which, by the time one had reached sixty-five, had mostly ceased to
exasperate. Mr Vetch could still feel a certain sharpness on the subject of the
prayer-book and the bishops; and if at moments he was a little ashamed of
having accepted this world he could reflect that at all events he continued to
repudiate every other. The idea of great changes, however, took its place among
the dreams of his youth; for what was any possible change in the relations of
men and women but a new combination of the same elements? If the elements could
be made different the thing would be worth thinking of; but it was not only
impossible to introduce any new ones&mdash;no means had yet been discovered for
getting rid of the old. The figures on the chessboard were still the passions
and jealousies and superstitions and stupidities of man, and their position
with regard to each other, at any given moment, could be of interest only to
the grim, invisible fates who played the game&mdash;who sat, through the ages,
bow-backed over the table. This laxity had come upon the old man with the
increase of his measurement round the waist, of the little heap of half-crowns
and half-sovereigns that had accumulated in a tin box with a very stiff
padlock, which he kept under his bed, and of the interwoven threads of
sentiment and custom that united him to the dressmaker and her foster-son. If
he was no longer pressing about the demands he felt he should have a right to
make of society, as he had been in the days when his conversation scandalised
Pinnie, so he was now not pressing for Hyacinth, either; reflecting that
though, indeed, the constituted powers might have to &lsquo;count&rsquo; with
him, it would be in better taste for him not to be importunate about a
settlement. What he had come to fear for him was that he should be precipitated
by crude agencies, with results in which the deplorable might not exclude the
ridiculous. It may even be said that Mr Vetch had a secret project of settling
a little on his behalf.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora peeped into the room, very noiselessly, nearly half an hour after
Hyacinth had left it, and let the fiddler know that she was called to other
duties but that the nurse had come back and the doctor had promised to look in
at five o&rsquo;clock. She herself would return in the evening, and meanwhile
Hyacinth was with his aunt, who had recognised him, without a protest; indeed
seemed intensely happy that he should be near her again, and lay there with
closed eyes, very weak and speechless, with his hand in hers. Her restlessness
had passed and her fever abated, but she had no pulse to speak of and Lady
Aurora did not disguise the fact that, in her opinion, she was rapidly sinking.
Mr Vetch had already accepted it, and after her ladyship had quitted him he
lighted another philosophic pipe upon it, lingering on, till the doctor came,
in the dressmaker&rsquo;s dismal, forsaken bower, where, in past years, he had
indulged in so many sociable droppings-in and hot tumblers. The echo of all her
little simple surprises and pointless contradictions, her gasping reception of
contemplative paradox, seemed still to float in the air; but the place felt as
relinquished and bereaved as if she were already beneath the sod. Pinnie had
always been a wonderful hand at &lsquo;putting away&rsquo;; the litter that
testified to her most elaborate efforts was often immense, but the reaction in
favour of an unspeckled carpet was greater still; and on the present occasion,
before taking to her bed, she had found strength to sweep and set in order as
daintily as if she had been sure that the room would never again know her care.
Even to the old fiddler, who had not Hyacinth&rsquo;s sensibility to the
scenery of life, it had the cold propriety of a place arranged for an
interment. After the doctor had seen Pinnie, that afternoon, there was no doubt
left as to its soon being the stage of dismal preliminaries.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pynsent, however, resisted her malady for nearly a fortnight more, during
which Hyacinth was constantly in her room. He never went back to Mr
Crookenden&rsquo;s, with whose establishment, through violent causes, his
relations seemed indefinitely suspended; and in fact, for the rest of the time
that Pinnie demanded his care he absented himself but twice from Lomax Place
for more than a few minutes. On one of these occasions he travelled over to
Audley Court and spent an hour there; on the other he met Millicent Henning, by
appointment, and took a walk with her on the Embankment. He tried to find a
moment to go and thank Madame Poupin for a sympathetic offering, many times
repeated, of <i>tisane</i>, concocted after a receipt thought supreme by the
couple in Lisson Grove (though little appreciated in the neighbourhood
generally); but he was obliged to acknowledge her kindness only by a respectful
letter, which he composed with some trouble, though much elation, in the French
tongue, peculiarly favourable, as he believed, to little courtesies of this
kind. Lady Aurora came again and again to the darkened house, where she
diffused her beneficent influence in nightly watches; in the most modern
sanative suggestions, in conversations with Hyacinth, directed with more
ingenuity than her fluttered embarrassments might have led one to attribute to
her, to the purpose of diverting his mind, and in tea-makings (there was a
great deal of this liquid consumed on the premises during Pinnie&rsquo;s
illness), after a system more enlightened than the usual fashion of
Pentonville. She was the bearer of several messages and of a good deal of
medical advice from Rose Muniment, whose interest in the dressmaker&rsquo;s
case irritated Hyacinth by its fine courage, which even at second-hand was
still obtrusive; she appeared very nearly as resigned to the troubles of others
as she was to her own.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had been seized, the day after his return from Medley, with a sharp
desire to do something enterprising and superior on Pinnie&rsquo;s behalf. He
felt the pressure of a sort of angry sense that she was dying of her poor
career, of her uneffaced remorse for the trick she had played him in his
boyhood (as if he hadn&rsquo;t long ago, and indeed at the time, forgiven it,
judging it to have been the highest wisdom!), of something basely helpless in
the attitude of her little circle. He wanted to do something which should prove
to himself that he had got the best opinion about the invalid that it was
possible to have: so he insisted that Mr Buffery should consult with a West End
doctor, if the West End doctor would consent to meet Mr Buffery. A physician
capable of this condescension was discovered through Lady Aurora&rsquo;s agency
(she had not brought him of her own movement, because on the one hand she
hesitated to impose on the little household in Lomax Place the expense of such
a visit, and on the other, with all her narrow personal economies for the sake
of her charities, had not the means to meet it herself); and in prevision of
the great man&rsquo;s fee Hyacinth applied to Mr Vetch, as he had applied
before, for a loan. The great man came, and was wonderfully civil to Mr
Buffery, whose conduct of the case he pronounced judicious; he remained several
minutes in the house, while he gazed at Hyacinth over his spectacles (he seemed
rather more occupied with him than with the patient), and almost the whole of
the Place turned out to stare at his chariot. After all, he consented to accept
no fee. He put the question aside with a gesture full of urbanity&mdash;a
course disappointing and displeasing to Hyacinth, who felt in a manner cheated
of the full effect of the fine thing he had wished to do for Pinnie; though
when he said as much (or something like it) to Mr Vetch, the caustic fiddler
greeted the observation with a face of amusement which, considering the
situation, verged upon the unseemly.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth, at any rate, had done the best he could, and the fashionable doctor
had left directions which foreshadowed relations with an expensive chemist in
Bond Street&mdash;a prospect by which our young man was to some extent
consoled. Poor Pinnie&rsquo;s decline, however, was not arrested, and one
evening, more than a week after his return from Medley, as he sat with her
alone, it seemed to Hyacinth that her spirit must already have passed away. The
nurse had gone down to her supper, and from the staircase a perceptible odour
of fizzling bacon indicated that a more cheerful state of things prevailed in
the lower regions. Hyacinth could not make out whether Miss Pynsent were asleep
or awake; he believed she had not lost consciousness, yet for more than an hour
she had given no sign of life. At last she put out her hand, as if she knew he
was near her and wished to feel for his, and murmured, &ldquo;Why did she come?
I didn&rsquo;t want to see her.&rdquo; In a moment, as she went on, he
perceived to whom she was alluding: her mind had travelled back, through all
the years, to the dreadful day (she had described every incident of it to him)
when Mrs Bowerbank had invaded her quiet life and startled her sensitive
conscience with a message from the prison. &ldquo;She sat there so
long&mdash;so long. She was very large, and I was frightened. She moaned, and
moaned, and cried&mdash;too dreadful. I couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; Her thought wandered from Mrs Bowerbank in the
discomposed show-room, enthroned on the yellow sofa, to the tragic creature at
Milbank, whose accents again, for the hour, lived in her ears; and mixed with
this mingled vision was still the haunting sense that she herself might have
acted differently. That had been cleared up in the past, so far as
Hyacinth&rsquo;s intention was concerned; but what was most alive in Pinnie at
the present moment was the passion of repentance, of still further expiation.
It sickened Hyacinth that she should believe these things were still necessary,
and he leaned over her and talked tenderly, with words of comfort and
reassurance. He told her not to think of that dismal, far-off time, which had
ceased long ago to have any consequences for either of them; to consider only
the future, when she should be quite strong again and he would look after her
and keep her all to himself and take care of her better, far better, than he
had ever done before. He had thought of many things while he sat with Pinnie,
watching the shadows made by the night-lamp&mdash;high, imposing shadows of
objects low and mean&mdash;and among them he had followed, with an imagination
that went further in that direction than ever before, the probable consequences
of his not having been adopted in his babyhood by the dressmaker. The workhouse
and the gutter, ignorance and cold, filth and tatters, nights of huddling under
bridges and in doorways, vermin, starvation and blows, possibly even the
vigorous efflorescence of an inherited disposition to crime&mdash;these things,
which he saw with unprecedented vividness, suggested themselves as his natural
portion. Intimacies with a princess, visits to fine old country-houses,
intelligent consideration, even, of the best means of inflicting a scare on the
classes of privilege, would in that case not have been within his compass; and
that Pinnie should have rescued him from such a destiny and put these luxuries
within his reach was an amelioration which really amounted to success, if he
could only have the magnanimity to regard it so.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were open and fixed on him, but the sharp ray the little dressmaker
used to direct into Lomax Place as she plied her needle at the window had
completely left them. &ldquo;Not there&mdash;what should I do there?&rdquo; she
inquired, very softly. &ldquo;Not with the great&mdash;the great&mdash;&rdquo;
and her voice failed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The great what? What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know&mdash;you know,&rdquo; she went on, making another effort.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been with them? Haven&rsquo;t they received
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, they won&rsquo;t separate us, Pinnie; they won&rsquo;t come between
us as much as that,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, kneeling by her bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> must be separate&mdash;that makes me happier. I knew they
would find you at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Pinnie, poor Pinnie,&rdquo; murmured the young man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was only for that&mdash;now I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; she went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll stay with me you needn&rsquo;t fear,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth, smiling at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what would <i>they</i> think?&rdquo; asked the dressmaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like you best,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have had me always. Now it&rsquo;s their turn; they have
waited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, they have waited!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they will make it up; they will make up everything!&rdquo; the
invalid panted. Then she added, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
help it!&rdquo;&mdash;which was the last flicker of her strength. She gave no
further sign of consciousness, and four days later she ceased to breathe.
Hyacinth was with her, and Lady Aurora, but neither of them could recognise the
moment.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth and Mr Vetch carried her bier, with the help of Eustache Poupin and
Paul Muniment. Lady Aurora was at the funeral, and Madame Poupin as well, and
twenty neighbours from Lomax Place; but the most distinguished person (in
appearance at least) in the group of mourners was Millicent Henning, the grave
yet brilliant beauty of whose countenance, the high propriety of whose
demeanour, and the fine taste and general style of whose black
&lsquo;costume&rsquo; excited no little attention. Mr Vetch had his idea; he
had been nursing it ever since Hyacinth&rsquo;s return from Medley, and three
days after Pinnie had been consigned to the earth he broached it to his young
friend. The funeral had been on a Friday, and Hyacinth had mentioned to him
that he should return to Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s on the Monday morning. This was
Sunday night, and Hyacinth had been out for a walk, neither with Millicent
Henning nor with Paul Muniment, but alone, after the manner of old days. When
he came in he found the fiddler waiting for him, and burning a tallow candle,
in the blighted show-room. He had three or four little papers in his hand,
which exhibited some jottings of his pencil, and Hyacinth guessed, what was the
truth but not all the truth, that he had come to speak to him about business.
Pinnie had left a little will, of which she had appointed her old friend
executor; this fact had already become known to our hero, who thought such an
arrangement highly natural. Mr Vetch informed him of the purport of this simple
and judicious document, and mentioned that he had been looking into the
dressmaker&rsquo;s &lsquo;affairs&rsquo;. They consisted, poor Pinnie&rsquo;s
affairs, of the furniture of the house in Lomax Place, of the obligation to pay
the remainder of a quarter&rsquo;s rent, and of a sum of money in the
savings-bank. Hyacinth was surprised to learn that Pinnie&rsquo;s economies had
produced fruit at this late day (things had gone so ill with her in recent
years, and there had been often such a want of money in the house), until Mr
Vetch explained to him, with eager clearness, that he himself had watched over
the little hoard, accumulated during the period of her comparative prosperity,
with the stiff determination that it should be sacrificed only in case of
desperate necessity. Work had become scarce with Pinnie, but she could still do
it when it came, and the money was to be kept for the very possible period when
she should be helpless. Mercifully enough, she had not lived to see that day,
and the sum in the bank had survived her, though diminished by more than half.
She had left no debts but the matter of the house and those incurred during her
illness. Of course the fiddler had known&mdash;he hastened to give his young
friend this assurance&mdash;that Pinnie, had she become infirm, would have been
able to count absolutely upon <i>him</i> for the equivalent, in her old age, of
the protection she had given him in his youth. But what if an accident had
overtaken Hyacinth? What if he had incurred some nasty penalty for his
revolutionary dabblings, which, little dangerous as they might be to society,
were quite capable, in a country where authority, though good-natured, liked
occasionally to make an example, to put him on the wrong side of a prison-wall?
At any rate, for better or worse, by pinching and scraping, she had saved a
little, and of that little, after everything was paid off, a fraction would
still be left. Everything was bequeathed to Hyacinth&mdash;everything but a
couple of plated candlesticks and the old &lsquo;cheffonier&rsquo;, which had
been so handsome in its day; these Pinnie begged Mr Vetch to accept in
recognition of services beyond all price. The furniture, everything he
didn&rsquo;t want for his own use, Hyacinth could sell in a lump, and with the
proceeds he could wipe out old scores. The sum of money would remain to him; it
amounted, in its reduced condition, to about thirty-seven pounds. In mentioning
this figure Mr Vetch appeared to imply that Hyacinth would be master of a very
pretty little fortune. Even to the young man himself, in spite of his recent
initiations, it seemed far from contemptible; it represented sudden
possibilities of still not returning to old Crookenden&rsquo;s. It represented
them, that is, till, presently, he remembered the various advances made him by
the fiddler, and reflected that by the time these had been repaid there would
hardly be twenty pounds left. That, however, was a far larger sum than he had
ever had in his pocket at once. He thanked the old man for his information, and
remarked&mdash;and there was no hypocrisy in the speech&mdash;that he was very
sorry Pinnie had not given herself the benefit of the whole of the little fund
in her lifetime. To this her executor replied that it had yielded her an
interest far beyond any other investment; for he was persuaded she believed she
should never live to enjoy it, and this faith was rich in pictures, visions of
the effect such a windfall would produce in Hyacinth&rsquo;s career.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What effect did she mean&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo; Hyacinth inquired. As
soon as he had spoken he felt that he knew what the old man would say (it would
be a reference to Pinnie&rsquo;s belief in his reunion with his
&lsquo;relations&rsquo;, and the facilities that thirty-seven pounds would
afford him for cutting a figure among them); and for a moment Mr Vetch looked
at him as if exactly that response were on his lips. At the end of the moment,
however, he replied, quite differently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She hoped you would go abroad and see the world.&rdquo; The fiddler
watched his young friend; then he added, &ldquo;She had a particular wish that
you should go to Paris.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had turned pale at this suggestion, and for a moment he said nothing.
&ldquo;Ah, Paris!&rdquo; he murmured, at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She would have liked you even to take a little run down to Italy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doubtless that would be pleasant. But there is a limit to what one can
do with twenty pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, with twenty pounds?&rdquo; the old man asked, lifting
his eyebrows, while the wrinkles in his forehead made deep shadows in the
candlelight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about what will remain, after I have settled my account
with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, your account with me? I shall not take any of your
money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth&rsquo;s eyes wandered over his interlocutor&rsquo;s suggestive
rustiness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be ungracious, but suppose <i>you</i>
should lose your powers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear boy, I shall have one of the resources that was open to Pinnie.
I shall look to you to be the support of my old age.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may do so with perfect safety, except for that danger you just
mentioned, of my being imprisoned or hanged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s precisely because I think it will be less if you go abroad
that I urge you to take this chance. You will see the world, and you will like
it better. You will think society, even as it is, has some good points,&rdquo;
said Mr Vetch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never liked it better than the last few months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah well, wait till you see Paris!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Paris&mdash;Paris,&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated, vaguely, staring into
the turbid flame of the candle as if he made out the most brilliant scenes
there; an attitude, accent and expression which the fiddler interpreted both as
the vibration of a latent hereditary chord and a symptom of the acute sense of
opportunity.

<p>
The boulevard was all alive, brilliant with illuminations, with the variety and
gaiety of the crowd, the dazzle of shops and cafés seen through uncovered
fronts or immense lucid plates, the flamboyant porches of theatres and the
flashing lamps of carriages, the far-spreading murmur of talkers and strollers,
the uproar of pleasure and prosperity, the general magnificence of Paris on a
perfect evening in June. Hyacinth had been walking about all day&mdash;he had
walked from rising till bed-time every day of the week that had elapsed since
his arrival&mdash;and now an extraordinary fatigue, which, however, was not
without its delight (there was a kind of richness, a sweet satiety, in it), a
tremendous lassitude had fallen upon him, and he settled himself in a chair
beside a little table in front of Tortoni&rsquo;s, not so much to rest from it
as to enjoy it. He had seen so much, felt so much, learned so much, thrilled
and throbbed and laughed and sighed so much, during the past several days, that
he was conscious at last of the danger of becoming incoherent to himself, of
the need of balancing his accounts.
</p>

<p>
To-night he came to a full stop; he simply sat at the door of the most
dandified café in Paris and felt his pulse and took stock of his impressions.
He had been intending to visit the Variétés theatre, which blazed through
intermediate lights and through the thin foliage of trees not favoured by the
asphalt, on the other side of the great avenue. But the impression of
Chaumont&mdash;he relinquished that, for the present; it added to the luxury of
his situation to reflect that he should still have plenty of time to see the
<i>succès du jour</i>. The same effect proceeded from his determination to
order a <i>marquise</i>, when the waiter, whose superior shirt-front and
whisker emerged from the long white cylinder of an apron, came to take his
commands. He knew the decoction was expensive&mdash;he had learnt as much at
the moment he happened to overhear, for the first time, a mention of it; which
had been the night before, in his place in a stall, during an
<i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>, at the <i>Comédie Française</i>. A gentleman beside
him, a young man in evening-dress, conversing with an acquaintance in the row
behind, recommended the latter to refresh himself with the article in question
after the play: there was nothing like it, the speaker remarked, of a hot
evening, in the open air, when one was thirsty. The waiter brought Hyacinth a
tall glass of champagne, in which a pine-apple ice was in solution, and our
hero felt that he had hoped for a sensation no less delicate when he looked for
an empty table on Tortoni&rsquo;s terrace. Very few tables were empty, and it
was his belief that the others were occupied by high celebrities; at any rate
they were just the types he had had a prevision of and had wanted most to meet,
when the extraordinary opportunity to come abroad with his pocket full of money
(it was more extraordinary, even, than his original meeting with the Princess)
became real to him in Lomax Place. He knew about Tortoni&rsquo;s from his study
of the French novel, and as he sat there he had a vague sense of fraternising
with Balzac and Alfred de Musset; there were echoes and reminiscences of their
works in the air, confounding themselves with the indefinable exhalations, the
strange composite odour, half agreeable, half impure, of the boulevard.
&lsquo;Splendid Paris, charming Paris&rsquo;&mdash;that refrain, the fragment
of an invocation, a beginning without an end, hummed itself perpetually in
Hyacinth&rsquo;s ears; the only articulate words that got themselves uttered in
the hymn of praise which his imagination had been offering to the French
capital from the first hour of his stay. He recognised, he greeted, with a
thousand palpitations, the seat of his maternal ancestors&mdash;was proud to be
associated with so much of the superb, so many proofs of a civilisation that
had no visible rough spots. He had his perplexities, and he had even now and
then a revulsion for which he had made no allowance, as when it came over him
that the most brilliant city in the world was also the most blood-stained; but
the great sense that he understood and sympathised was preponderant, and his
comprehension gave him wings&mdash;appeared to transport him to still wider
fields of knowledge, still higher sensations.
</p>

<p>
In other days, in London, he had thought again and again of his mother&rsquo;s
father, the revolutionary watch-maker who had known the ecstasy of the
barricade and had paid for it with his life, and his reveries had not been
sensibly chilled by the fact that he knew next to nothing about him. He figured
him in his mind, had a conviction that he was very short, like himself, and had
curly hair, an immense talent for his work and an extraordinary natural
eloquence, together with many of the most attractive qualities of the French
character. But he was reckless, and a little cracked, and probably immoral; he
had difficulties and debts and irrepressible passions; his life had been an
incurable fever and its tragic termination was a matter of course. None the
less it would have been a charm to hear him talk, to feel the influence of a
gaiety which even political madness could never quench; for his grandson had a
theory that he spoke the French tongue of an earlier time, delightful and
sociable in accent and phrase, exempt from the commonness of modern slang. This
vague yet vivid personage became Hyacinth&rsquo;s constant companion, from the
day of his arrival; he roamed about with Florentine&rsquo;s boy, hand in hand,
sat opposite to him at dinner, at the small table in the restaurant, finished
the bottle with him, made the bill a little longer, and treated him to
innumerable revelations and counsels. He knew the lad&rsquo;s secret without
being told, and looked at him across the diminutive tablecloth, where the great
tube of bread, pushed aside a little, left room for his elbows (it puzzled
Hyacinth that the people of Paris should ever have had the fierceness of hunger
when the loaves were so big), gazed at him with eyes of deep, kind, glowing
comprehension and with lips which seemed to murmur that when one was to die
to-morrow one was wise to eat and drink to-day. There was nothing venerable, no
constraint of importance or disapproval, in this edifying and impalpable
presence; the young man considered that Hyacinthe Vivier was of his own time of
life and could enter into his pleasures as well as his pains. Wondering,
repeatedly, where the barricade on which his grandfather fell had been erected,
he at last satisfied himself (but I am unable to trace the process of the
induction) that it had bristled across the Rue Saint-Honoré, very near to the
church of Saint-Roch. The pair had now roamed together through all the museums
and gardens, through the principal churches (the republican martyr was very
good-natured about this), through the passages and arcades, up and down the
great avenues, across all the bridges, and above all, again and again, along
the river, where the quays were an endless entertainment to Hyacinth, who
lingered by the half-hour beside the boxes of old books on the parapets,
stuffing his pockets with five-penny volumes, while the bright industries of
the Seine flashed and glittered beneath him, and on the other bank the glorious
Louvre stretched either way for a league. Our young man took almost the same
sort of satisfaction in the Louvre as if he had erected it; he haunted the
museum during all the first days, and couldn&rsquo;t look enough at certain
pictures, nor sufficiently admire the high polish of the great floors in which
the golden, frescoed ceilings repeated themselves. All Paris struck him as
tremendously artistic and decorative; he felt as if hitherto he had lived in a
dusky, frowsy, Philistine world, in which the taste was the taste of Little
Pedlington and the idea of beautiful arrangement had never had an influence. In
his ancestral city it had been active from the first, and that was why his
quick sensibility responded; and he murmured again his constant refrain, when
the fairness of the great monuments arrested him, in the pearly, silvery light,
or he saw them take gray-blue, delicate tones at the end of stately vistas. It
seemed to him that Paris expressed herself, and did it in the grand style,
while London remained vague and blurred, inarticulate, blunt and dim.

<p>
Eustache Poupin had given him letters to three or four democratic friends,
ardent votaries of the social question, who had by a miracle either escaped the
cruelty of exile or suffered the outrage of pardon, and, in spite of republican
<i>mouchards</i>, no less infamous than the imperial, and the periodical swoops
of despotism which had only changed its buttons and postage-stamps, kept alive
the sacred spark which would some day become a consuming flame. Hyacinth,
however, had not had the thought of delivering these introductions; he had
accepted them because Poupin had had such a solemn glee in writing them, and
also because he had not the courage to let the couple in Lisson Grove know that
since that terrible night at Hoffendahl&rsquo;s a change had come over the
spirit of his dream. He had not grown more concentrated, he had grown more
relaxed, and it was inconsistent with relaxation that he should rummage out
Poupin&rsquo;s friends&mdash;one of whom lived in the Batignolles and the
others in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine&mdash;and pretend that he cared for what
they cared for in the same way as they cared for it. What was supreme in his
mind to-day was not the idea of how the society that surrounded him should be
destroyed; it was, much more, the sense of the wonderful, precious things it
had produced, of the brilliant, impressive fabric it had raised. That
destruction was waiting for it there was forcible evidence, known to himself
and others, to show; but since this truth had risen before him, in its
magnitude he had become conscious of a transfer, partial if not complete, of
his sympathies; the same revulsion of which he had given a sign to the Princess
in saying that now he pitied the rich, those who were regarded as happy. While
the evening passed, therefore, as he kept his place at Tortoni&rsquo;s, the
emotion that was last to visit him was a compunction for not having put himself
in relation with poor Poupin&rsquo;s friends, for having neglected to make the
acquaintance of earnest people.
</p>

<p>
Who in the world, if one should come to that, was as earnest as he himself, or
had given such signal even though secret proofs of it? He could lay that
unction to his soul in spite of his having amused himself cynically, spent all
his time in theatres, galleries, walks of pleasure. The feeling had not failed
him with which he accepted Mr Vetch&rsquo;s furtherance&mdash;the sense that
since he was destined to perish in his flower he was right to make a dash at
the beautiful, horrible world. That reflection had been natural enough, but
what was strange was the fiddler&rsquo;s own impulse, his desire to do
something pleasant for him, to beguile him and ship him off. What had been most
odd in that was the way Mr Vetch appeared to overlook the fact that his young
friend had already had, that year, such an episode of dissipation as was surely
rare in the experience of London artisans. This was one of the many things
Hyacinth thought of; he thought of the others in turn and out of turn; it was
almost the first time he had sat still long enough (except at the theatre) to
collect himself. A hundred confused reverberations of the recent past crowded
upon him, and he saw that he had lived more intensely in the previous six
months than in all the rest of his existence. The succession of events finally
straightened itself, and he tasted some of the rarest, strangest moments over
again. His last week at Medley, in especial, had already become a kind of
fable, the echo of a song; he could read it over like a story, gaze at it as he
would have gazed at some exquisite picture. His visit there had been perfect to
the end, and even the three days that Captain Sholto&rsquo;s sojourn lasted had
not broken the spell, for the three more that had elapsed before his own
departure (the Princess herself had given him the signal) were the most
important of all. It was then the Princess had made it clear to him that she
was in earnest, was prepared for the last sacrifice. She was now his standard
of comparison, his authority, his measure, his perpetual reference; and in
taking possession of his mind to this extent she had completely renewed it. She
was altogether a new term, and now that he was in a foreign country he observed
how much her conversation, itself so foreign, had prepared him to understand
it. In Paris he saw, of course, a great many women, and he noticed almost all
of them, especially the actresses; confronting, mentally, their movement, their
speech, their manner of dressing, with that of his extraordinary friend. He
judged that she was beyond them in every respect, though there were one or two
actresses who had the air of trying to copy her.
</p>

<p>
The recollection of the last days he had spent with her affected him now like
the touch of a tear-washed cheek. She had shed tears for him, and it was his
suspicion that her secret idea was to frustrate the redemption of his vow to
Hoffendahl, to the immeasurable body that Hoffendahl represented. She pretended
to have accepted it, and what she said was simply that when he should have
played his part she would engage to save him&mdash;to fling a cloud about him,
as the goddess-mother of the Trojan hero used, in Virgil&rsquo;s poem, to
<i>escamoter</i> Æneas. What she meant was, in his view, to prevent him from
playing his part at all. She was earnest for herself, not for him. The main
result of his concentrated intimacy with her had been to make him feel that he
was good enough for anything. When he had asked her, the last day, if he might
write to her, she had said, Yes, but not for two or three weeks. He had written
after Pinnie&rsquo;s death, and again just before coming abroad, and in doing
so had taken account of something else she had said in regard to their
correspondence&mdash;that she didn&rsquo;t wish vague phrases, protestations or
compliments; she wanted the realities of his life, the smallest, most personal
details. Therefore he had treated her to the whole business of the break-up in
Lomax Place, including the sale of the rickety furniture. He had told her what
that transaction brought&mdash;a beggarly sum, but sufficient to help a little
to pay debts; and he had informed her furthermore that one of the ways Mr Vetch
had taken to hurry him off to Paris was to offer him a present of thirty pounds
out of his curious little hoard, to add to the sum already inherited from
Pinnie&mdash;which, in a manner that none of Hyacinth&rsquo;s friends, of
course, could possibly regard as frugal, or even as respectable, was now
consecrated to a mere excursion. He even mentioned that he had ended by
accepting the thirty pounds, adding that he feared there was something
demoralising in his peculiar situation (she would know what he meant by that):
it disposed one to take what one could get, made one at least very tolerant of
whims that happened to be munificent.
</p>

<p>
What he did not mention to the Princess was the manner in which he had been
received by Paul Muniment and by Millicent Henning on his return from Medley.
Millicent&rsquo;s reception had been the queerest; it had been quite
unexpectedly mild. She made him no scene of violence, and appeared to have
given up the line of throwing a blur of recrimination over her own nefarious
doings. She treated him as if she liked him for having got in with the swells;
she had an appreciation of success which would lead her to handle him more
tenderly now that he was really successful. She tried to make him describe the
style of life that was led in a house where people were invited to stay like
that without having to pay, and she surprised him almost as much as she
gratified him by not indulging in any of her former digs at the Princess. She
was lavish of ejaculations when he answered certain of her
questions&mdash;ejaculations that savoured of Pimlico, &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Oh, my stars!&rdquo;&mdash;and he was more than ever struck with her
detestable habit of saying, &ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s where it is,&rdquo; when
he had made some remark to which she wished to give an intelligent and
sympathetic assent. But she didn&rsquo;t jeer at the Princess&rsquo;s private
character; she stayed her satire, in a case where there was such an opening for
it. Hyacinth reflected that this was lucky for her: he couldn&rsquo;t have
stood it (nervous and anxious as he was about Pinnie) if she had had the bad
taste, at such a time as that, to be profane and insulting. In that case he
would have broken with her completely&mdash;he would have been too disgusted.
She displeased him enough, as it was, by her vulgar tricks of speech. There
were two or three little recurrent irregularities that aggravated him to a
degree quite out of proportion to their importance, as when she said
&lsquo;full up&rsquo; for full, &lsquo;sold out&rsquo; for sold, or remarked to
him that she supposed he was now going to chuck up his work at old
Crookenden&rsquo;s. These phrases had fallen upon his ear many a time before,
but now they seemed almost unpardonable enough to quarrel about. Not that he
had any wish to quarrel, for if the question had been pushed he would have
admitted that to-day his intimacy with the Princess had caused any rights he
might have had upon Millicent to lapse. Millicent did not push it, however; she
only, it was evident, wished to convey to him that it was better for both
parties they should respect each other&rsquo;s liberty. A genial understanding
on this subject was what Miss Henning desired, and Hyacinth forbade himself to
inquire what use she proposed to make of her freedom. During the month that
elapsed between Pinnie&rsquo;s death and his visit to Paris he had seen her
several times, for the respect for each other&rsquo;s freedom had somehow not
implied cessation of intercourse, and it was only natural she should have been
soft to him in his bereaved condition. Hyacinth&rsquo;s sentiment about Pinnie
was deep, and Millicent was clever enough to guess it; the consequence of which
was that on these occasions she was very soft indeed. She talked to him almost
as if she had been his mother and he a convalescent child; called him her dear,
and a young rascal, and her old boy; moralised a good deal, abstained from beer
(till she learned he had inherited a fortune), and when he remarked once
(moralising a little, too) that after the death of a person we have loved we
are haunted by the memory of our failures of kindness, of generosity, rejoined,
with a dignity that made the words almost a contribution to philosophy,
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s where it is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Something in her behaviour at this period had even made Hyacinth wonder whether
there were not some mystical sign in his appearance, some subtle betrayal in
the very expression of his face, of the predicament in which he had been placed
by Diedrich Hoffendahl; he began to suspect afresh the operation of that
&lsquo;beastly <i>attendrissement</i>&rsquo; he had detected of old in people
who had the benefit of Miss Pynsent&rsquo;s innuendoes. The compassion
Millicent felt for him had never been one of the reasons why he liked her; it
had fortunately been corrected, moreover, by his power to make her furious.
This evening, on the boulevard, as he watched the interminable successions, one
of the ideas that came to him was that it was odd he should like her even yet;
for heaven knew he liked the Princess better, and he had hitherto supposed that
when a sentiment of this kind had the energy of a possession it made a clean
sweep of all minor predilections. But it was clear to him that Millicent still
existed for him; that he couldn&rsquo;t feel he had quite done with her, or she
with him; and that in spite of his having now so many other things to admire
there was still a comfort in the recollection of her robust beauty and her
primitive passions. Hyacinth thought of her as some clever young barbarian who
in ancient days should have made a pilgrimage to Rome might have thought of a
Dacian or Iberian mistress awaiting his return on the rough provincial shore.
If Millicent considered his visit at a &lsquo;hall&rsquo; a proof of the sort
of success that was to attend him (how he reconciled this with the supposition
that she perceived, as a ghostly irradiation, intermingled with his curly hair,
the aureola of martyrdom, he would have had some difficulty in explaining), if
Miss Henning considered, on his return from Medley, that he had taken his place
on the winning side, it was only consistent of her to borrow a grandeur from
his further travels; and, indeed, by the time he was ready to start she spoke
of the plan as if she had invented it herself and even contributed materially
to the funds required. It had been her theory, from the first, that she only
liked people of spirit; and Hyacinth certainly had never had so much spirit as
when he launched himself into Continental adventures. He could say to himself,
quite without bitterness, that of course she would profit by his absence to put
her relations with Sholto on a comfortable footing; yet, somehow, at this
moment, as her face came back to him amid the crowd of faces about him, it had
not that gentleman&rsquo;s romantic shadow across it. It was the brilliancy of
Paris, perhaps, that made him see things rosy; at any rate, he remembered with
kindness something that she had said to him the last time he saw her and that
had touched him exceedingly at the moment. He had happened to observe to her,
in a friendly way, that now Miss Pynsent had gone she was, with the exception
of Mr Vetch, the person in his whole circle who had known him longest. To this
Millicent had replied that Mr Vetch wouldn&rsquo;t live for ever, and then she
should have the satisfaction of being his very oldest friend. &ldquo;Oh, well,
I shan&rsquo;t live for ever, either,&rdquo; said Hyacinth; which led her to
inquire whether by chance he had a weakness of the chest. &ldquo;Not that I
know of, but I might get killed in a row;&rdquo; and when she broke out into
scorn of his silly notion of turning everything up (as if any one wanted to
know what a costermonger would like, or any of that low sort at the East End!)
he amused himself with asking her if she were satisfied with the condition of
society and thought nothing ought to be done for people who, at the end of a
lifetime of starvation-wages, had only the reward of the hideous workhouse and
a pauper&rsquo;s grave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied with anything, if ever you was to slip
up,&rdquo; Millicent answered, simply, looking at him with her beautiful
boldness. Then she added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I can tell <i>you</i>,
Mr Robinson: that if ever any one was to do you a turn&mdash;&rdquo; And she
paused again, tossing back the head she carried as if it were surmounted by a
tiara, while Hyacinth inquired what would occur in that contingency.
&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;d be <i>one</i> left behind who would take it
up!&rdquo; she announced; and in the tone of the declaration there was
something brave and genuine. It struck Hyacinth as a strange fate&mdash;though
not stranger, after all, than his native circumstances&mdash;that one&rsquo;s
memory should come to be represented by a shop-girl overladen with bracelets of
imitation silver; but he was reminded that Millicent was a fine specimen of a
woman of a type opposed to the whining, and that in her free temperament many
disparities were reconciled.

<p>
On the other hand the brilliancy of Paris had not much power to transfigure the
impression made upon him by such intercourse with Paul Muniment as he had
enjoyed during the weeks that followed Pinnie&rsquo;s death&mdash;an impression
considerably more severe than any idea of renunciation or oblivion that could
connect itself with Millicent. Why it should have had the taste of sadness was
not altogether clear, for Muniment&rsquo;s voice was as distinct as any in the
chorus of approbation excited by the news that Hyacinth was about to cultivate
the most characteristic of the pleasures of gentility&mdash;a sympathetic
unanimity, of which the effect was to place his journey to Paris in a light
almost ridiculous. What had got into them all, and did they think he was good
for nothing but to amuse himself? Mr Vetch had been the most zealous, but the
others clapped him on the back in almost exactly the same manner as he had seen
his mates in Soho bring their palms down on one of their number when it was
disclosed to them that his &lsquo;missus&rsquo; had made him yet once again a
father. That had been Poupin&rsquo;s tone, and his wife&rsquo;s as well; and
even poor Schinkel, with his everlasting bandage, whom he had met in Lisson
Grove, appeared to think it necessary to remark that a little run across the
Rhine, while he was about it, would open his eyes to a great many wonders. The
Poupins shed tears of joy, and the letters which have already been mentioned,
and which lay day after day on the mantel-shelf of the little room our hero
occupied in a <i>hôtel garni</i>, tremendously tall and somewhat lopsided, in
the Rue Jacob (that recommendation proceeded also from Lisson Grove, the
<i>garni</i> being kept by a second cousin of Madame Eustache), these valuable
documents had been prepared by the obliging exile many days before his young
friend was ready to start. It was almost refreshing to Hyacinth when old
Crookenden, the sole outspoken dissentient, told him he was a blockhead to
waste his money on the bloody French. This worthy employer of labour was
evidently disgusted at such an innovation; if he wanted a little recreation why
couldn&rsquo;t he take it as it had been taken in Soho from the beginning of
time, in the shape of a trip to Hampton Court or two or three days of alcoholic
torpor? Old Crookenden was right. Hyacinth conceded freely that he was a
blockhead, and was only a little uncomfortable that he couldn&rsquo;t explain
why he didn&rsquo;t pretend not to be and had a kind of right to that
compensatory luxury.
</p>

<p>
Paul guessed why, of course, and smiled approval with a candour which gave
Hyacinth a strange, inexpressible heartache. He already knew that his
friend&rsquo;s view of him was that he was ornamental and adapted to the
lighter kinds of socialistic utility&mdash;constituted to show that the
revolution was not necessarily brutal and illiterate; but in the light of the
cheerful stoicism with which Muniment regarded the sacrifice our hero was
committed to, the latter had found it necessary to remodel a good deal his
original conception of the young chemist&rsquo;s nature. The result of this
process was not that he admired it less but that he felt almost awe-stricken in
the presence of it. There had been an element of that sort in his appreciation
of Muniment from the first, but it had been infinitely deepened by the
spectacle of his sublime consistency. Hyacinth felt that he himself could never
have risen to that point. He was competent to make the promise to Hoffendahl,
and he was equally competent to keep it; but he could not have had the same
fortitude for another, could not have detached himself from personal prejudice
so effectually as to put forward, in that way, for the terrible
&lsquo;job&rsquo;, a little chap he liked. That Muniment liked him it never
occurred to Hyacinth to doubt, and certainly he had all the manner of it
to-day: he had never been more good-humoured, more placidly talkative; he was
like an elder brother who knew that the &lsquo;youngster&rsquo; was clever, and
was rather proud of it even when there was no one there to see. That air of
suspending their partnership for the moment, which had usually marked him at
the &lsquo;Sun and Moon&rsquo;, was never visible in other places; in Audley
Court he only chaffed Hyacinth occasionally for taking him too seriously.
To-day his young friend hardly knew just how to take him; the episode of which
Hoffendahl was the central figure had, as far as one could see, made so little
change in his life. As a conspirator he was so extraordinarily candid, and
bitterness and denunciation so rarely sat on his lips. It was as if he had been
ashamed to complain; and indeed, for himself, as the months went on, he had
nothing particular to complain of. He had had a rise, at the chemical works,
and a plan of getting a larger room for Rosy was under serious consideration.
On behalf of others he never sounded the pathetic note&mdash;he thought that
sort of thing unbusiness-like; and the most that he did in the way of
expatiation on the wrongs of humanity was occasionally to mention certain
statistics, certain &lsquo;returns&rsquo;, in regard to the remuneration of
industries, applications for employment and the discharge of hands. In such
matters as these he was deeply versed, and he moved in a dry statistical and
scientific air in which it cost Hyacinth an effort of respiration to accompany
him. Simple and kindly as he was, and thoughtful of the woes of beasts,
attentive and merciful to small insects, and addicted even to kissing dirty
babies in Audley Court, he sometimes emitted a short satiric gleam which showed
that his esteem for the poor was small and that if he had no illusions about
the people who had got everything into their hands he had as few about those
who had egregiously failed to do so. He was tremendously reasonable, which was
largely why Hyacinth admired him, having a desire to be so himself but finding
it terribly difficult.
</p>

<p>
Muniment&rsquo;s absence of passion, his fresh-coloured coolness, his easy,
exact knowledge, the way he kept himself clean (except for the chemical stains
on his hands) in circumstances of foul contact, constituted a group of
qualities that had always appeared to Hyacinth singularly enviable. Most
enviable of all was the force that enabled him to sink personal sentiment where
a great public good was to be attempted and yet keep up the form of caring for
that minor interest. It seemed to Hyacinth that if <i>he</i> had introduced a
young fellow to Hoffendahl for his purposes, and Hoffendahl had accepted him on
such a recommendation, and everything had been settled, he would have preferred
never to look at the young fellow again. That was his weakness, and Muniment
carried it off far otherwise. It must be added that he had never made an
allusion to their visit to Hoffendahl; so that Hyacinth also, out of pride,
held his tongue on the subject. If his friend didn&rsquo;t wish to express any
sympathy for him he was not going to beg for it (especially as he didn&rsquo;t
want it) by restless references. It had originally been a surprise to him that
Muniment should be willing to countenance a possible assassination; but after
all none of his ideas were narrow (Hyacinth had a sense that they ripened all
the while), and if a pistol-shot would do any good he was not the man to raise
pedantic objections. It is true that, as regards his quiet acceptance of the
predicament in which Hyacinth might be placed by it, our young man had given
him the benefit of a certain amount of doubt; it had occurred to him that
perhaps Muniment had his own reasons for believing that the summons from
Hoffendahl would never really arrive, so that he might only be treating himself
to the entertainment of judging of a little bookbinder&rsquo;s nerve. But in
this case, why did he take an interest in the little bookbinder&rsquo;s going
to Paris? That was a thing he would not have cared for if he had held that in
fact there was nothing to fear. He despised the sight of idleness, and in spite
of the indulgence he had more than once been good enough to express on the
subject of Hyacinth&rsquo;s epicurean tendencies what he would have been most
likely to say at present was, &lsquo;Go to Paris? Go to the dickens!
Haven&rsquo;t you been out at grass long enough for one while, didn&rsquo;t you
lark enough in the country there with the noble lady, and hadn&rsquo;t you
better take up your tools again before you forget how to handle them?&rsquo;
Rosy had said something of that sort, in her free, familiar way (whatever her
intention, she had been, in effect, only a little less sarcastic than old
Crookenden): that Mr Robinson was going in for a life of leisure, a life of
luxury, like herself; she must congratulate him on having the means and the
time. Oh, the time&mdash;that was the great thing! She could speak with
knowledge, having always enjoyed these advantages herself. And she
intimated&mdash;or was she mistaken?&mdash;that his good fortune emulated hers
also in the matter of his having a high-born and beneficent friend (such a
blessing, now he had lost dear Miss Pynsent), who covered him with little
attentions. Rose Muniment, in short, had been more exasperating than ever.
</p>

<p>
The boulevard became even more brilliant as the evening went on, and Hyacinth
wondered whether he had a right to occupy the same table for so many hours. The
theatre on the other side discharged its multitude; the crowd thickened on the
wide asphalt, on the terrace of the café; gentlemen, accompanied by ladies of
whom he knew already how to characterise the type&mdash;<i>des femmes
très-chic</i>&mdash;passed into the portals of Tortoni. The nightly emanation
of Paris seemed to rise more richly, to float and hang in the air, to mingle
with the universal light and the many-voiced sound, to resolve itself into a
thousand solicitations and opportunities, addressed however mainly to those in
whose pockets the chink of a little loose gold might respond. Hyacinth&rsquo;s
retrospections had not made him drowsy, but quite the reverse; he grew restless
and excited, and a kind of pleasant terror of the place and hour entered into
his blood. But it was nearly midnight, and he got up to walk home, taking the
line of the boulevard toward the Madeleine. He passed down the Rue Royale,
where comparative stillness reigned; and when he reached the Place de la
Concorde, to cross the bridge which faces the Corps Législatif, he found
himself almost isolated. He had left the human swarm and the obstructed
pavements behind, and the wide spaces of the splendid square lay quiet under
the summer stars. The plash of the great fountains was audible, and he could
almost hear the wind-stirred murmur of the little wood of the Tuileries on one
side, and of the vague expanse of the Champs Elysées on the other. The place
itself&mdash;the Place Louis Quinze, the Place de la Révolution&mdash;had given
him a sensible emotion, from the day of his arrival; he had recognised so
quickly its tremendously historic character. He had seen, in a rapid vision,
the guillotine in the middle, on the site of the inscrutable obelisk, and the
tumbrils, with waiting victims, were stationed round the circle now made
majestic by the monuments of the cities of France. The great legend of the
French Revolution, sanguinary and heroic, was more real to him here than
anywhere else; and, strangely, what was most present was not its turpitude and
horror, but its magnificent energy, the spirit of life that had been in it, not
the spirit of death. That shadow was effaced by the modern fairness of fountain
and statue, the stately perspective and composition; and as he lingered, before
crossing the Seine, a sudden sense overtook him, making his heart sink with a
kind of desolation&mdash;a sense of everything that might hold one to the
world, of the sweetness of not dying, the fascination of great cities, the
charm of travel and discovery, the generosity of admiration. The tears rose to
his eyes, as they had done more than once in the past six months, and a
question, low but poignant, broke from his lips, ending in nothing: &ldquo;How
could he&mdash;how <i>could</i> he&mdash;?&rdquo; It may be explained that
&lsquo;he&rsquo; was a reference to Paul Muniment; for Hyacinth had dreamed of
the religion of friendship.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks after this he found himself in Venice, whence he addressed to the
Princess Casamassima a letter of which I reproduce the principal passages.
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;This is probably the last time I shall write to you before I return to
London. Of course you have been in this place, and you will easily understand
why here, especially here, the spirit should move me. Dear Princess, what an
enchanted city, what ineffable impressions, what a revelation of the exquisite!
I have a room in a little <i>campo</i> opposite to a small old church, which
has cracked marble slabs let into the front; and in the cracks grow little wild
delicate flowers, of which I don&rsquo;t know the name. Over the door of the
church hangs an old battered leather curtain, polished and tawny, as thick as a
mattress, and with buttons in it, like a sofa; and it flops to and fro,
laboriously, as women and girls, with shawls on their heads and their feet in
little wooden shoes which have nothing but toes, pass in and out. In the middle
of the campo is a fountain, which looks still older than the church; it has a
primitive, barbaric air, and I have an idea it was put there by the first
settlers&mdash;those who came to Venice from the mainland, from Aquileia.
Observe how much historical information I have already absorbed; it won&rsquo;t
surprise you, however, for you never wondered at anything after you discovered
I knew something of Schopenhauer. I assure you, I don&rsquo;t think of that
musty misogynist in the least to-day, for I bend a genial eye on the women and
girls I just spoke of, as they glide, with a small clatter and with their old
copper water-jars, to the fountain. The Venetian girl-face is wonderfully sweet
and the effect is charming when its pale, sad oval (they all look under-fed) is
framed in the old faded shawl. They also have very fascinating hair, which
never has done curling, and they slip along together, in couples or threes,
interlinked by the arms and never meeting one&rsquo;s eye (so that its
geniality doesn&rsquo;t matter), dressed in thin, cheap cotton gowns, whose
limp folds make the same delightful line that everything else in Italy makes.
The weather is splendid and I roast&mdash;but I like it; apparently, I was made
to be spitted and &ldquo;done&rdquo;, and I discover that I have been cold all
my life, even when I thought I was warm. I have seen none of the beautiful
patricians who sat for the great painters&mdash;the gorgeous beings whose
golden hair was intertwined with pearls; but I am studying Italian in order to
talk with the shuffling, clicking maidens who work in the
bead-factories&mdash;I am determined to make one or two of them look at me.
When they have filled their old water-pots at the fountain it is jolly to see
them perch them on their heads and patter away over the polished Venetian
stones. It&rsquo;s a charm to be in a country where the women don&rsquo;t wear
the hideous British bonnet. Even in my own class (excuse the expression&mdash;I
remember it used to offend you), I have never known a young female, in London,
to put her nose out of the door without it; and if you had frequented such
young females as much as I have you would have learned of what degradation that
dreary necessity is the source. The floor of my room is composed of little
brick tiles, and to freshen the air, in this temperature, one sprinkles it, as
you no doubt know, with water. Before long, if I keep on sprinkling, I shall be
able to swim about; the green shutters are closed, and the place makes a very
good tank. Through the chinks the hot light of the campo comes in. I smoke
cigarettes, and in the pauses of this composition recline on a faded magenta
divan in the corner. Convenient to my hand, in that attitude, are the works of
Leopardi and a second-hand dictionary. I am very happy&mdash;happier than I
have ever been in my life save at Medley&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care for
anything but the present hour. It won&rsquo;t last long, for I am spending all
my money. When I have finished this I shall go forth and wander about in the
splendid Venetian afternoon; and I shall spend the evening in that enchanted
square of St Mark&rsquo;s, which resembles an immense open-air drawing-room,
listening to music and feeling the sea-breeze blow in between those two strange
old columns, in the piazzetta, which seem to make a portal for it. I can
scarcely believe that it&rsquo;s of myself that I am telling these fine things;
I say to myself a dozen times a day that Hyacinth Robinson is not in it&mdash;I
pinch my leg to see if I&rsquo;m not dreaming. But a short time hence, when I
have resumed the exercise of my profession, in sweet Soho, I shall have proof
enough that it has been my very self: I shall know that by the terrible grind
I shall feel my work to be.
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;That will mean, no doubt, that I&rsquo;m deeply demoralised. It
won&rsquo;t be for you, however, in this case, to cast the stone at me; for my
demoralisation began from the moment I first approached you. Dear Princess, I
may have done you good, but you haven&rsquo;t done me much. I trust you will
understand what I mean by that speech, and not think it flippant or
impertinent. I may have helped you to understand and enter into the misery of
the people (though I protest I don&rsquo;t know much about it), but you have
led my imagination into quite another train. However, I don&rsquo;t mean to
pretend that it&rsquo;s all your fault if I have lost sight of the sacred cause
almost altogether in my recent adventures. It is not that it has not been there
to see, for that perhaps is the clearest result of extending one&rsquo;s
horizon&mdash;the sense, increasing as we go, that want and toil and suffering
are the constant lot of the immense majority of the human race. I have found
them everywhere, but I haven&rsquo;t minded them. Excuse the cynical
confession. What has struck me is the great achievements of which man has been
capable in spite of them&mdash;the splendid accumulations of the happier few,
to which, doubtless, the miserable many have also in their degree contributed.
The face of Europe appears to be covered with them, and they have had much the
greater part of my attention. They seem to me inestimably precious and
beautiful, and I have become conscious, more than ever before, of how little I
understand what, in the great rectification, you and Poupin propose to do with
them. Dear Princess, there are things which I shall be sorry to see you touch,
even you with your hands divine; and&mdash;shall I tell you <i>le fond de ma
pensée</i>, as you used to say?&mdash;I feel myself capable of fighting for
them. You can&rsquo;t call me a traitor, for you know the obligation that I
recognise. The monuments and treasures of art, the great palaces and
properties, the conquests of learning and taste, the general fabric of
civilisation as we know it, based, if you will, upon all the despotisms, the
cruelties, the exclusions, the monopolies and the rapacities of the past, but
thanks to which, all the same, the world is less impracticable and life more
tolerable&mdash;our friend Hoffendahl seems to me to hold them too cheap and to
wish to substitute for them something in which I can&rsquo;t somehow believe as
I do in things with which the aspirations and the tears of generations have
been mixed. You know how extraordinary I think our Hoffendahl (to speak only of
him); but if there is one thing that is more clear about him than another it is
that he wouldn&rsquo;t have the least feeling for this incomparable, abominable
old Venice. He would cut up the ceilings of the Veronese into strips, so that
every one might have a little piece. I don&rsquo;t want every one to have a
little piece of anything, and I have a great horror of that kind of invidious
jealousy which is at the bottom of the idea of a redistribution. You will say
that I talk of it at my ease, while, in a delicious capital, I smoke cigarettes
on a magenta divan; and I give you leave to scoff at me if it turns out that,
when I come back to London without a penny in my pocket, I don&rsquo;t hold the
same language. I don&rsquo;t know what it comes from, but during the last three
months there has crept over me a deep mistrust of that same grudging
attitude&mdash;the intolerance of positions and fortunes that are higher and
brighter than one&rsquo;s own; a fear, moreover, that I may, in the past, have
been actuated by such motives, and a devout hope that if I am to pass away
while I am yet young it may not be with that odious stain upon my soul.&rsquo;

<h3><a name="chap31"></a>XXXI</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth spent three days, after his return to London, in a process which he
supposed to be the quest of a lodging; but in reality he was pulling himself
together for the business of his livelihood&mdash;an effort he found by no
means easy or agreeable. As he had told the Princess, he was demoralised, and
the perspective of Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s dirty staircase had never seemed so
steep. He lingered on the brink, before he plunged again into Soho; he wished
not to go back to the shop till he should be settled, and he delayed to get
settled in order not to go back to the shop. He saw no one during this
interval, not even Mr Vetch; he waited to call upon the fiddler till he should
have the appearance of not coming as a beggar or a borrower&mdash;have
recovered his employment and be able to give an address, as he had heard
Captain Sholto say. He went to South Street&mdash;not meaning to go in at once
but wishing to look at the house&mdash;and there he had the surprise of
perceiving a bill of sale in the window of the Princess&rsquo;s late residence.
He had not expected to find her in town (he had heard from her the last time
three weeks before, and then she said nothing about her prospects), but he was
puzzled by this indication that she had moved away altogether. There was
something in this, however, which he felt that at bottom he had looked for; it
appeared a proof of the justice of a certain suspicious, uneasy sentiment from
which one could never be quite free, in one&rsquo;s intercourse with the
Princess&mdash;a vague apprehension that one might suddenly stretch out
one&rsquo;s hand and miss her altogether from one&rsquo;s side. Hyacinth
decided to ring at the door and ask for news of her; but there was no response
to his summons: the stillness of an August afternoon (the year had come round
again from his first visit) hung over the place, the blinds were down and the
caretaker appeared to be absent. Under these circumstances Hyacinth was much at
a loss; unless, indeed, he should address a letter to his wonderful friend at
Medley. It would doubtless be forwarded, though her short lease of the
country-house had terminated, as he knew, several weeks before. Captain Sholto
was of course a possible medium of communication; but nothing would have
induced Hyacinth to ask such a service of him.
</p>

<p>
He turned away from South Street with a curious sinking of the heart; his state
of ignorance struck inward, as it were&mdash;had the force of a vague,
disquieting portent. He went to old Crookenden&rsquo;s only when he had arrived
at his last penny. This, however, was very promptly the case. He had
disembarked at London Bridge with only seventeen pence in his pocket, and he
had lived on that sum for three days. The old fiddler in Lomax Place was having
a chop before he went to the theatre, and he invited Hyacinth to share his
repast, sending out at the same time for another pot of beer. He took the youth
with him to the play, where, as at that season there were very few spectators,
he had no difficulty in finding him a place. He seemed to wish to keep hold of
him, and looked at him strangely, over his spectacles (Mr Vetch wore the homely
double glass in these latter years), when he learned that Hyacinth had taken a
lodging not in their old familiar quarter but in the unexplored purlieus of
Westminster. What had determined our young man was the fact that from this part
of the town the journey was comparatively a short one to Camberwell; he had
suffered so much, before Pinnie&rsquo;s death, from being separated by such a
distance from his best friends. There was a pang in his heart connected with
the image of Paul Muniment, but none the less the prospect of an evening hour
in Audley Court, from time to time, appeared one of his most definite sources
of satisfaction in the future. He could have gone straight to Camberwell to
live, but that would carry him too far from the scene of his profession; and in
Westminster he was much nearer to old Crookenden&rsquo;s than he had been in
Lomax Place. He said to Mr Vetch that if it would give him pleasure he would
abandon his lodging and take another in Pentonville. But the old man replied,
after a moment, that he should be sorry to put that constraint upon him; if he
were to make such an exaction Hyacinth would think he wanted to watch him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, to watch me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch had begun to tune his fiddle, and he scraped it a little before
answering. &ldquo;I mean it as I have always meant it. Surely you know that in
Lomax Place I had my eyes on you. I watched you as a child on the edge of a
pond watches the little boat he has constructed and set afloat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t discover much. You saw, after all, very little of
me,&rdquo; Hyacinth said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I made what I could of that little; it was better than nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth laid his hand gently on the old man&rsquo;s arm; he had never felt so
kindly to him, not even when he accepted the thirty pounds, before going
abroad, as at this moment. &ldquo;Certainly I will come and see you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was much obliged to you for your letters,&rdquo; Mr Vetch remarked,
without heeding these words, and continuing to scrape. He had always, even into
the shabbiness of his old age, kept that mark of English good-breeding (which
is composed of some such odd elements), that there was a shyness, an aversion
to possible phrase-making, in his manner of expressing gratitude for favours,
and that in spite of this cursory tone his acknowledgment had ever the accent
of sincerity.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth took but little interest in the play, which was an inanimate revival;
he had been at the <i>Théâtre Français</i> and the tradition of that house was
still sufficiently present to him to make any other style of interpretation
appear of the clumsiest. He sat in one of the front stalls, close to the
orchestra; and while the piece went forward&mdash;or backward, ever backward,
as it seemed to him&mdash;his thoughts wandered far from the shabby scene and
the dusty boards, revolving round a question which had come up immensely during
the last few hours. The Princess was a <i>capricciosa</i>&mdash;that, at least,
was Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s account of her; and was that blank, expressionless
house in South Street a sign that an end had come to the particular caprice in
which he had happened to be involved? He had returned to London with an ache of
eagerness to be with her again on the same terms as at Medley, a throbbing
sense that unless she had been abominably dishonest he might count upon her.
This state of mind was by no means complete security, but it was so sweet that
it mattered little whether it were sound. Circumstances had favoured in an
extraordinary degree his visit to her, and it was by no means clear that they
would again be so accommodating or that what had been possible for a few days
should be possible with continuity, in the midst of the ceremonies and
complications of London. Hyacinth felt poorer than he had ever felt before,
inasmuch as he had had money and spent it, whereas in previous times he had
never had it to spend. He never for an instant regretted his squandered
fortune, for he said to himself that he had made a good bargain and become
master of a precious equivalent. The equivalent was a rich experience&mdash;an
experience which would become richer still as he should talk it over, in a low
chair, close to hers, with the all-comprehending, all-suggesting lady of his
life. His poverty would be no obstacle to their intercourse so long as he
should have a pair of legs to carry him to her door; for she liked him better
shabby than when he was furbished up, and she had given him too many pledges,
they had taken together too many appointments, worked out too many programmes,
to be disconcerted (on either side) by obstacles that were merely a part of the
general conventionality. He was to go with her into the slums, to introduce her
to the worst that London contained (he should have, precisely, to make
acquaintance with it first), to show her the reality of the horrors of which
she dreamed that the world might be purged. He had ceased, himself, to care for
the slums, and had reasons for not wishing to spend his remnant in the
contemplation of foul things; but he would go through with his part of the
engagement. He might be perfunctory, but any dreariness would have a gilding
that should involve an association with her. What if she should have changed,
have ceased to care? What if, from a kind of royal insolence which he suspected
to lurk somewhere in the side-scenes of her nature, though he had really not
once seen it peep out, she should toss back her perfect head with a movement
signifying that he was too basely literal and that she knew him no more?
Hyacinth&rsquo;s imagination represented her this evening in places where a
barrier of dazzling light shut her out from access, or even from any appeal. He
saw her with other people, in splendid rooms, where &lsquo;the dukes&rsquo; had
possession of her, smiling, satisfied, surrounded, covered with jewels. When
this vision grew intense he found a reassurance in reflecting that after all
she would be unlikely to throw him personally over so long as she should remain
mixed up with what was being planned in the dark, and that it would not be easy
for her to liberate herself from that entanglement. She had of course told him
more, at Medley, of the manner in which she had already committed herself, and
he remembered, with a strange perverse elation, that she had gone very far
indeed.
</p>

<p>
In the intervals of the foolish play Mr Vetch, who lingered in his place in the
orchestra while his mates descended into the little hole under the stage,
leaned over the rail and asked his young friend occasional questions, carrying
his eyes at the same time up about the dingy house, at whose smoky ceiling and
tarnished galleries he had been staring for so many a year. He came back to
Hyacinth&rsquo;s letters, and said, &ldquo;Of course you know they were clever;
they entertained me immensely. But as I read them I thought of poor Pinnie: I
wished she could have listened to them; they would have made her so
happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, poor Pinnie,&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured, while Mr Vetch went
on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was in Paris in 1840; I stayed at a small hotel in the Rue Mogador. I
judge everything is changed, from your letters. Does the Rue Mogador still
exist? Yes, everything is changed. I dare say it&rsquo;s all much finer, but I
liked it very much as it was then. At all events, I am right in
supposing&mdash;am I not?&mdash;that it cheered you up considerably, made you
really happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I have wanted any cheering? I was happy enough,&rdquo;
Hyacinth replied.
</p>

<p>
The fiddler turned his old white face upon him; it had the unhealthy smoothness
which denotes a sedentary occupation, thirty years spent in a close crowd, amid
the smoke of lamps and the odour of stage-paint. &ldquo;I thought you were sad
about Pinnie,&rdquo; he remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I jumped, with that avidity, at your proposal that I should take a
tour? Poor old Pinnie!&rdquo; Hyacinth added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I hope you think a little better of the world. We mustn&rsquo;t
make up our mind too early in life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have made up mine: it&rsquo;s an awfully jolly place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Awfully jolly, no; but I like it as I like an old pair of shoes&mdash;I
like so much less the idea of putting on the new ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I complain?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked. &ldquo;What have I known
but kindness? People have done such a lot for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, of course, they have liked you. But that&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; murmured Mr Vetch, beginning to scrape again. What remained in
Hyacinth&rsquo;s mind from this conversation was the fact that the old man,
whom he regarded distinctly as cultivated, had thought his letters clever. He
only wished that he had made them cleverer still; he had no doubt of his
ability to have done so.
</p>

<p>
It may be imagined whether the first hours he spent at old Crookenden&rsquo;s,
after he took up work again, were altogether to his taste, and what was the
nature of the reception given him by his former comrades, whom he found exactly
in the same attitudes and the same clothes (he knew and hated every article
they wore), and with the same primitive pleasantries on their lips. Our young
man&rsquo;s feelings were mingled; the place and the people appeared to him
loathsome, but there was something delightful in handling his tools. He gave a
little private groan of relief when he discovered that he still liked his work
and that the pleasant swarm of his ideas (in the matter of sides and backs)
returned to him. They came in still brighter, more suggestive form, and he had
the satisfaction of feeling that his taste had improved, that it had been
purified by experience, and that the covers of a book might be made to express
an astonishing number of high conceptions. Strange enough it was, and a proof
surely, of our little hero&rsquo;s being a genuine artist, that the impressions
he had accumulated during the last few months appeared to mingle and confound
themselves with the very sources of his craft and to be susceptible of
technical representation. He had quite determined, by this time, to carry on
his life as if nothing were hanging over him, and he had no intention of
remaining a little bookbinder to the end of his days; for that medium, after
all, would translate only some of his conceptions. Yet his trade was a
resource, an undiminished resource, for the present, and he had a particular as
well as a general motive in attempting new flights&mdash;the prevision of the
exquisite work which he was to do during the coming year for the Princess and
which it was very definite to him he owed her. When that debt should have been
paid and his other arrears made up he proposed to himself to write something.
He was far from having decided as yet what it should be; the only point settled
was that it should be very remarkable and should not, at least on the face of
it, have anything to do with a fresh deal of the social pack. That was to be
his transition&mdash;into literature; to bind the book, charming as the process
might be, was after all much less fundamental than to write it. It had occurred
to Hyacinth more than once that it would be a fine thing to produce a brilliant
death-song.
</p>

<p>
It is not surprising that among such reveries as this he should have been
conscious of a narrow range in the tone of his old workfellows. They had only
one idea: that he had come into a thousand pounds and had gone to spend them in
France with a regular high one. He was aware, in advance, of the diffusion of
this legend, and did his best to allow for it, taking the simplest course,
which was not to contradict it but to catch the ball as it came and toss it
still further, enlarging and embroidering humorously until Grugan and Roker and
Hotchkin and all the rest, who struck him as not having washed since he left
them, seemed really to begin to understand how it was he could have spent such
a rare sum in so short a time. The impressiveness of this achievement helped
him greatly to slip into his place; he could see that, though the treatment it
received was superficially irreverent, the sense that he was very sharp and
that the springs of his sharpness were somehow secret gained a good deal of
strength from it. Hyacinth was not incapable of being rather pleased that it
<i>should</i> be supposed, even by Grugan, Roker and Hotchkin, that he could
get rid of a thousand pounds in less than five months, especially as to his own
conscience the fact had altogether yet to be proved. He got off, on the whole,
easily enough to feel a little ashamed, and he reflected that the men at
Crookenden&rsquo;s, at any rate, showed no symptoms of the social jealousy
lying at the bottom of the desire for a fresh deal. This was doubtless an
accident, and not inherent in the fact that they were highly skilled workmen
(old Crookenden had no others), and therefore sure of constant employment; for
it was impossible to be more skilled, in one&rsquo;s own line, than Paul
Muniment was, and yet he (though not out of jealousy, of course) went in for
the great restitution. What struck him most, after he had got used again to the
sense of his apron and bent his back a while over his battered table, was the
simple, synthetic patience of the others, who had bent <i>their</i> backs and
felt the rub of that dirty drapery all the while he was lounging in the halls
of Medley, dawdling through boulevards and museums, and admiring the purity of
the Venetian girl-face. With Poupin, to be sure, his relations were special;
but the explanations that he owed the sensitive Frenchman were not such as
could make him very unhappy, once he had determined to resist as much as
possible the friction of his remaining days. There was moreover more sorrow
than anger in Poupin&rsquo;s face when he learned that his young friend and
pupil had failed to cultivate, in Paris, the rich opportunities he had offered
him. &ldquo;You are cooling off, my child; there is something about you! Have
you the weakness to flatter yourself that anything has been done, or that
humanity suffers a particle less? <i>Enfin</i>, it&rsquo;s between you and your
conscience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think I want to get out of it?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, smiling;
Eustache Poupin&rsquo;s phrases about humanity, which used to thrill him so,
having grown of late strangely hollow and <i>rococo</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You owe me no explanations; the conscience of the individual is
absolute, except, of course, in those classes in which, from the very nature of
the infamies on which they are founded, no conscience can exist. Speak to me,
however, of my Paris; <i>she</i> is always divine,&rdquo; Poupin went on; but
he showed signs of irritation when Hyacinth began to praise to him the
magnificent creations of the arch-fiend of December. In the presence of this
picture he was in a terrible dilemma: he was gratified as a Parisian and a
patriot but he was disconcerted as a lover of liberty; it cost him a pang to
admit that anything in the sacred city was defective, yet he saw still less his
way to concede that it could owe any charm to the perjured monster of the
second Empire, or even to the hypocritical, mendacious republicanism of the
régime before which the sacred Commune had gone down in blood and fire.
&ldquo;Ah, yes, it&rsquo;s very fine, no doubt,&rdquo; he remarked at last,
&ldquo;but it will be finer still when it&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo;&mdash;a speech
which caused Hyacinth to turn back to his work with a slight feeling of
sickness. Everywhere, everywhere, he saw the ulcer of envy&mdash;the passion of
a party which hung together for the purpose of despoiling another to its
advantage. In old Eustache, one of the &lsquo;pure&rsquo;, this was
particularly sad.

<h3><a name="chap32"></a>XXXII</h3>

<p>
The landing at the top of the stairs in Audley Court was always dark; but it
seemed darker than ever to Hyacinth while he fumbled for the door-latch, after
he had heard Rose Muniment&rsquo;s penetrating voice bid him come in. During
that instant his ear caught the sound&mdash;if it could trust itself&mdash;of
another voice, which prepared him, a little, for the spectacle that offered
itself as soon as the door (his attempt to reach the handle, in his sudden
agitation, proving fruitless) was opened to him by Paul. His friend stood
there, tall and hospitable, saying something loud and jovial, which he
didn&rsquo;t distinguish. His eyes had crossed the threshold in a flash, but
his step faltered a moment, only to obey, however, the vigour of
Muniment&rsquo;s outstretched hand. Hyacinth&rsquo;s glance had gone straight,
and though with four persons in it Rosy&rsquo;s little apartment looked
crowded, he saw no one but the object of his quick preconception&mdash;no one
but the Princess Casamassima, seated beside the low sofa (the grand feature
introduced during his absence from London) on which, arrayed in the famous pink
dressing-gown, Miss Muniment now received her visitors. He wondered afterwards
why he should have been so startled; for he had said, often enough, both to
himself and to the Princess, that so far as she was concerned he was proof
against astonishment; it was so evident that, in her behaviour, the unexpected
was the only thing to be looked for. In fact, now that he perceived she had
made her way to Camberwell without his assistance, the feeling that took
possession of him was a kind of embarrassment; he blushed a little as he
entered the circle, the fourth member of which was inevitably Lady Aurora
Langrish. Was it that his intimacy with the Princess gave him a certain sense
of responsibility for her conduct in respect to people who knew her as yet but
a little, and that there was something that required explanation in the
confidence with which she had practised a descent upon them? It is true that it
came over our young man that by this time, perhaps, they knew her a good deal;
and moreover a woman&rsquo;s conduct spoke for itself when she could sit
looking, in that fashion, like a radiant angel dressed in a simple bonnet and
mantle and immensely interested in an appealing corner of the earth. It took
Hyacinth but an instant to perceive that her character was in a different phase
from any that had yet been exhibited to him. There had been a brilliant
mildness about her the night he made her acquaintance, and she had never
ceased, at any moment since, to strike him as an exquisitely human, sentient,
pitying organisation; unless it might be, indeed, in relation to her husband,
against whom&mdash;for reasons, after all, doubtless, very sufficient&mdash;her
heart appeared absolutely steeled. But now her face looked at him through a
sort of glorious charity. She had put off her splendour, but her beauty was
unquenchably bright; she had made herself humble for her pious excursion; she
had, beside Rosy (who, in the pink dressing-gown, looked much the more
luxurious of the two), almost the attitude of a hospital nurse; and it was easy
to see, from the meagre line of her garments, that she was tremendously in
earnest. If Hyacinth was flurried her own countenance expressed no confusion;
for her, evidently, this queer little chamber of poverty and pain was a place
in which it was perfectly natural that <i>he</i> should turn up. The sweet,
still greeting her eyes offered him might almost have conveyed to him that she
had been waiting for him, that she knew he would come and that there had been a
tacit appointment for that very moment. They said other things beside, in their
beautiful friendliness: they said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t notice me too much, or
make any kind of scene. I have an immense deal to say to you, but remember that
I have the rest of our life before me to say it in. Consider only what will be
easiest and kindest to these people, these delightful people, whom I find
enchanting (why didn&rsquo;t you ever tell me more&mdash;I mean really
more&mdash;about them?). It won&rsquo;t be particularly complimentary to them
if you have the air of seeing a miracle in my presence here. I am very glad of
your return. The quavering, fidgety &ldquo;ladyship&rdquo; is as fascinating as
the others.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth&rsquo;s reception at the hands of his old friends was cordial enough
quite to obliterate the element of irony that had lurked, three months before,
in their godspeed; their welcome was not boisterous, but it seemed to express
the idea that the occasion was already so rare and agreeable that his arrival
was all that was needed to make it perfect. By the time he had been three
minutes in the room he was able to measure the impression produced by the
Princess, who, it was clear, had thrown a spell of adoration over the little
company. This was in the air, in the face of each, in their excited, smiling
eyes and heightened colour; even Rosy&rsquo;s wan grimace, which was at all
times screwed up to ecstasy, emitted a supererogatory ray. Lady Aurora looked
more than ever dishevelled with interest and wonder; the long strands of her
silky hair floated like gossamer, as, in her extraordinary, religious attention
(her hands were raised and clasped to her bosom, as if she were praying), her
respiration rose and fell. She had never seen any one like the Princess; but
Hyacinth&rsquo;s apprehension, of some months before, had been
groundless&mdash;she evidently didn&rsquo;t think her vulgar. She thought her
divine, and a revelation of beauty and benignity; and the illuminated,
amplified room could contain no dissentient opinion. It was her beauty,
primarily, that &lsquo;fetched&rsquo; them, Hyacinth could easily see, and it
was not hidden from him that the sensation was as active in Paul Muniment as in
his companions. It was not in Paul&rsquo;s nature to be jerkily demonstrative,
and he had not lost his head on the present occasion; but he had already
appreciated the difference between one&rsquo;s preconception of a meretricious,
factitious fine lady and the actual influence of such a personage. She was
gentler, fairer, wiser, than a chemist&rsquo;s assistant could have guessed in
advance. In short, she held the trio in her hand (she had reduced Lady Aurora
to exactly the same simplicity as the others), and she performed, admirably,
artistically, for their benefit. Almost before Hyacinth had had time to wonder
how she had found the Muniments out (he had no recollection of giving her
specific directions), she mentioned that Captain Sholto had been so good as to
introduce her; doing so as if she owed him that explanation and were a woman
who would be scrupulous in such a case. It was rather a blow to him to hear
that she had been accepting the Captain&rsquo;s mediation, and this was not
softened by her saying that she was too impatient to wait for his own return;
he was apparently so happy on the Continent that one couldn&rsquo;t be sure it
would ever take place. The Princess might at least have been sure that to see
her again very soon was still more necessary to his happiness than anything the
Continent could offer.
</p>

<p>
It came out in the conversation he had with her, to which the others listened
with respectful curiosity, that Captain Sholto had brought her a week before,
but then she had seen only Miss Muniment. &ldquo;I took the liberty of coming
again, by myself, to-day, because I wanted to see the whole family,&rdquo; the
Princess remarked, looking from Paul to Lady Aurora, with a friendly gaiety in
her face which purified the observation (as regarded her ladyship) of
impertinence. The Princess added, frankly, that she had now been careful to
arrive at an hour when she thought Mr Muniment might be at home. &ldquo;When I
come to see gentlemen, I like at least to find them,&rdquo; she continued, and
she was so great a lady that there was no small diffidence in her attitude; it
was a simple matter for her to call on a chemist&rsquo;s assistant, if she had
a reason. Hyacinth could see that the reason had already been brought
forward&mdash;her immense interest in problems that Mr Muniment had completely
mastered, and in particular their common acquaintance with the extraordinary
man whose mission it was to solve them. Hyacinth learned later that she had
pronounced the name of Hoffendahl. A part of the lustre in Rosy&rsquo;s eye
came no doubt from the explanation she had inevitably been moved to make in
respect to any sympathy with wicked theories that might be imputed to
<i>her;</i> and of course the effect of this intensely individual little
protest (such was always its effect), emanating from the sofa and the pink
dressing-gown, was to render the Muniment interior still more quaint and
original. In that spot Paul always gave the go-by, humorously, to any attempt
to draw out his views, and you would have thought, to hear him, that he allowed
himself the reputation of having them only in order to get a &lsquo;rise&rsquo;
out of his sister and let their visitors see with what wit and spirit she could
repudiate them. This, however, would only be a reason the more for the
Princess&rsquo;s following up her scent. She would doubtless not expect to get
at the bottom of his ideas in Audley Court; the opportunity would occur,
rather, in case of his having the civility (on which surely she might count) to
come and talk them over with her in her own house.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth mentioned to her the disappointment he had had in South Street, and
she replied, &ldquo;Oh, I have given up that house, and taken quite a different
one.&rdquo; But she didn&rsquo;t say where it was, and in spite of her having
given him so much the right to expect she would communicate to him a matter so
nearly touching them both as a change of address, he felt a great shyness about
asking.
</p>

<p>
Their companions watched them as if they considered that something rather
brilliant, now, would be likely to come off between them; but Hyacinth was too
full of regard to the Princess&rsquo;s tacit notification to him that they must
not appear too thick, which was after all more flattering than the most
pressing inquiries or the most liberal announcements about herself could have
been. She never asked him when he had come back; and indeed it was not long
before Rose Muniment took that business upon herself. Hyacinth, however,
ventured to assure himself whether Madame Grandoni were still with the
Princess, and even to remark (when she had replied, &ldquo;Oh yes, still,
still. The great refusal, as Dante calls it, has not yet come off&rdquo;),
&ldquo;You ought to bring her to see Miss Rosy. She is a person Miss Rosy would
particularly appreciate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure I should be most happy to receive any friend of the Princess
Casamassima,&rdquo; said this young lady, from the sofa; and when the Princess
answered that she certainly would not fail to produce Madame Grandoni some day,
Hyacinth (though he doubted whether the presentation would really take place)
guessed how much she wished her old friend might have heard the strange
bedizened little invalid make that speech.
</p>

<p>
There were only three other seats, for the introduction of the sofa (a question
so profoundly studied in advance) had rendered necessary the elimination of
certain articles; so that Muniment, on his feet, hovered round the little
circle, with his hands in his pockets, laughing freely and sociably but not
looking at the Princess; though, as Hyacinth was sure, he was none the less
agitated by her presence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to tell us about foreign parts and the grand things you have
seen; except that, doubtless, our distinguished visitor knows all about
them,&rdquo; Muniment said to Hyacinth. Then he added, &ldquo;Surely, at any
rate, you have seen nothing more worthy of your respect than Camberwell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this the worst part?&rdquo; the Princess asked, looking up with her
noble, interested face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The worst, madam? What grand ideas you must have! We admire Camberwell
immensely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s ideas that are grand!&rdquo; cried Rose
Muniment, betraying him conscientiously. &ldquo;He does want everything
changed, no less than you, Princess; though he is more cunning than you, and
won&rsquo;t give one a handle where one can take him up. He thinks all this
part most objectionable&mdash;as if dirty people won&rsquo;t always make
everything dirty where they live! I dare say he thinks there ought to be no
dirty people, and it may be so; only if every one was clean, where would be the
merit? You would get no credit for keeping yourself tidy. At any rate, if
it&rsquo;s a question of soap and water, every one can begin by himself. My
brother thinks the whole place ought to be as handsome as Brompton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, that&rsquo;s where the artists and literary people live,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the Princess, attentively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never seen it, but it&rsquo;s very well laid out,&rdquo; Rosy
rejoined, with her competent air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I like Camberwell better than that,&rdquo; said Muniment,
hilariously.
</p>

<p>
The Princess turned to Lady Aurora, and with the air of appealing to her for
her opinion gave her a glance which travelled in a flash from the topmost bow
of her large, misfitting hat to the crumpled points of her substantial shoes.
&ldquo;I must get <i>you</i> to tell me the truth,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;I want so much to know London&mdash;the real London. It seems so
difficult!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora looked a little frightened, but at the same time gratified, and
after a moment she responded, &ldquo;I believe a great many artists live in St
John&rsquo;s Wood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the artists!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed,
shaking her head, slowly, with the sad smile which sometimes made her beauty so
inexpressibly touching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not when they have painted you such beautiful pictures?&rdquo; Rosy
demanded. &ldquo;We know about your pictures&mdash;we have admired them so
much. Mr Hyacinth has described to us your precious possessions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess transferred her smile to Rosy, and rested it on that young
lady&rsquo;s shrunken countenance with the same ineffable head-shake.
&ldquo;You do me too much honour. I have no possessions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gracious, was it all a make-believe?&rdquo; Rosy cried, flashing at
Hyacinth an eye that was never so eloquent as when it demanded an explanation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have nothing in the world&mdash;nothing but the clothes on my
back!&rdquo; the Princess repeated, very gravely, without looking at the young
man.
</p>

<p>
The words struck him as an admonition, so that, though he was much puzzled, he
made no attempt, for the moment, to reconcile the contradiction. He only
replied, &ldquo;I meant the things in the house. Of course I didn&rsquo;t know
whom they belonged to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are no things in my house now,&rdquo; the Princess went on; and
there was a touch of pure, high resignation in the words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laws, I shouldn&rsquo;t like that!&rdquo; Rose Muniment declared,
glancing, with complacency, over her own decorated walls. &ldquo;Everything
here belongs to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall bring Madame Grandoni to see you,&rdquo; said the Princess,
irrelevantly but kindly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s not right to have a lot of things about?&rdquo;
Lady Aurora, with sudden courage, queried of her distinguished companion,
pointing her chin at her but looking into the upper angle of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose one must always settle that for one&rsquo;s self. I
don&rsquo;t like to be surrounded with objects I don&rsquo;t care for; and I
can care only for one thing&mdash;that is, for one class of things&mdash;at a
time. Dear lady,&rdquo; the Princess went on, &ldquo;I fear I must confess to
you that my heart is not in <i>bibelots</i>. When thousands and tens of
thousands haven&rsquo;t bread to put in their mouths, I can dispense with
tapestry and old china.&rdquo; And her fair face, bent charmingly,
conciliatingly, on Lady Aurora, appeared to argue that if she was narrow at
least she was candid.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth wondered, rather vulgarly, what strange turn she had taken, and
whether this singular picture of her denuded personality were not one of her
famous caprices, a whimsical joke, a nervous perversity. Meanwhile, he heard
Lady Aurora urge, anxiously, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think we ought to make
the world more beautiful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the Princess make it so by the mere fact of her
existence?&rdquo; Hyacinth demanded; his perplexity escaping, in a harmless
manner, through this graceful hyperbole. He had observed that, though the lady
in question could dispense with old china and tapestry, she could not dispense
with a pair of immaculate gloves, which fitted her like a charm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My people have a mass of things, you know, but I have really nothing
myself,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora, as if she owed this assurance to such a
representative of suffering humanity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The world will be beautiful enough when it becomes good enough,&rdquo;
the Princess resumed. &ldquo;Is there anything so ugly as unjust distinctions,
as the privileges of the few contrasted with the degradation of the many? When
we want to beautify, we must begin at the right end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely there are none of us but what have our privileges!&rdquo; Rose
Muniment exclaimed, with eagerness. &ldquo;What do you say to mine, lying here
between two members of the aristocracy, and with Mr Hyacinth thrown in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are certainly lucky&mdash;with Lady Aurora Langrish. I wish she
would come and see <i>me</i>,&rdquo; the Princess murmured, getting up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do go, my lady, and tell me if it&rsquo;s so poor!&rdquo; Rosy went on,
gaily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think there can&rsquo;t be too many pictures and statues and works of
art,&rdquo; Hyacinth broke out. &ldquo;The more the better, whether people are
hungry or not. In the way of ameliorating influences, are not those the most
definite?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A piece of bread and butter is more to the purpose, if your
stomach&rsquo;s empty,&rdquo; the Princess declared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Robinson has been corrupted by foreign influences,&rdquo; Paul Muniment
suggested. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t care for bread and butter now; he likes
French cookery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t get it. And have you sent away the little man,
the Italian, with the white cap and apron?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked of the
Princess.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment, and then she replied, laughing, and not in the least
offended at his question, though it was an attempt to put her in the wrong from
which Hyacinth had not been able to refrain, in his astonishment at these
ascetic pretensions, &ldquo;I have sent him away many times!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora had also got up: she stood there gazing at her beautiful
fellow-visitor with a timidity which made her wonder only more apparent.
&ldquo;Your servants must be awfully fond of you,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my servants!&rdquo; murmured the Princess, as if it were only by a
stretch of the meaning of the word that she could be said to enjoy the
ministrations of menials. Her manner seemed to imply that she had a charwoman
for an hour a day. Hyacinth caught the tone, and determined that since she was
going, as it appeared, he would break off his own visit and accompany her. He
had flattered himself, at the end of three weeks of Medley, that he knew her in
every phase, but here was a field of freshness. She turned to Paul Muniment and
put out her hand to him, and while he took it in his own his face was visited
by the most beautiful eyes that had ever rested there. &ldquo;Will you come and
see me, one of these days?&rdquo; she asked, with a voice as sweet and clear as
her glance.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth waited for Paul&rsquo;s answer with an emotion that could only be
accounted for by his affectionate sympathy, the manner in which he had spoken
of him to the Princess and which he wished him to justify, the interest he had
in his appearing, completely, the fine fellow he believed him. Muniment neither
stammered nor blushed; he held himself straight, and looked back at his
interlocutress with an eye almost as crystalline as her own. Then, by way of
answer, he inquired, &ldquo;Well, madam, pray what good will it do me?&rdquo;
And the tone of the words was so humorous and kindly, and so instinct with a
plain manly sense, that though they were not gallant Hyacinth was not ashamed
for him. At the same moment he observed that Lady Aurora was watching their
friend as if she had at least an equal stake in what he might say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, none; only me, perhaps, a little.&rdquo; With this rejoinder, and
with a wonderful sweet, indulgent dignity, in which there was none of the
stiffness of pride or resentment, the Princess quitted him and approached Lady
Aurora. She asked her if <i>she</i> wouldn&rsquo;t do her the kindness to come.
She should like so much to know her, and she had an idea there was a great deal
they might talk about. Lady Aurora said she should be delighted, and the
Princess took one of her cards out of her pocket and gave it to the noble
spinster. After she had done so she stood a moment holding her hand, and
remarked, &ldquo;It has really been such a happiness to me to meet you. Please
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very clumsy if I say I <i>do</i> like you
so!&rdquo; Lady Aurora was evidently exceedingly moved and impressed; but Rosy,
when the Princess took farewell of her, and the irrepressible invalid had
assured her of the pleasure with which she should receive her again, admonished
her that in spite of this she could never conscientiously enter into such
theories.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If every one was equal,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;where would be the
gratification I feel in getting a visit from a grandee? That&rsquo;s what I
have often said to her ladyship, and I consider that I&rsquo;ve kept her in her
place a little. No, no; no equality while <i>I</i>&rsquo;m about the
place!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The company appeared to comprehend that there was a natural fitness in
Hyacinth&rsquo;s seeing the great lady on her way, and accordingly no effort
was made to detain him. He guided her, with the help of an attendant
illumination from Muniment, down the dusky staircase, and at the door of the
house there was a renewed brief leave-taking with the young chemist, who,
however, showed no signs of relenting or recanting in respect to the
Princess&rsquo;s invitation. The warm evening had by this time grown thick, and
the population of Audley Court appeared to be passing it, for the most part, in
the open air. As Hyacinth assisted his companion to thread her way through
groups of sprawling, chattering children, gossiping women with bare heads and
babies at the breast, and heavily-planted men smoking very bad pipes, it seemed
to him that their project of exploring the slums was already in the way of
execution. He said nothing till they had gained the outer street, and then,
pausing a moment, he inquired how she would be conveyed. Had she a carriage
somewhere, or should he try and get a cab?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A carriage, my dear fellow? For what do you take me? I won&rsquo;t
trouble you about a cab: I walk everywhere now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if I had not been here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have gone alone,&rdquo; said the Princess, smiling at him
through the turbid twilight of Camberwell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where, please, gracious heaven? I may at least have the honour of
accompanying you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, if you can walk so far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So far as what, dear Princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As Madeira Crescent, Paddington.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Madeira Crescent, Paddington?&rdquo; Hyacinth stared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call it when I&rsquo;m with people with whom I wish
to be fine, like you. I have taken a small house there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s really true that you have given up your beautiful
things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have sold them all, to give to the poor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Princess!&rdquo; the young man almost moaned; for the memory of some
of her treasures was vivid within him.
</p>

<p>
She became very grave, even stern, and with an accent of reproach that seemed
to show she had been wounded where she was most sensitive, she demanded,
&ldquo;When I said I was willing to make the last sacrifice, did you then
believe I was lying?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you kept <i>anything?</i>&rdquo; Hyacinth went on, without
heeding this challenge.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him a moment. &ldquo;I have kept <i>you!</i>&rdquo; Then she took
his arm, and they moved forward. He saw what she had done; she was living in a
little ugly, bare, middle-class house and wearing simple gowns; and the energy
and good faith of her behaviour, with the abruptness of the transformation,
took away his breath. &ldquo;I thought I should please you so much,&rdquo; she
added, after they had gone a few steps. And before he had time to reply, as
they came to a part of the street where there were small shops, those of
butchers, greengrocers and pork-pie men, with open fronts, flaring lamps and
humble purchasers, she broke out, joyously, &ldquo;Ah, this is the way I like
to see London!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap33"></a>XXXIII</h3>

<p>
The house in Madeira Crescent was a low, stucco-fronted edifice, in a shabby,
shallow semicircle, and Hyacinth could see, as they approached it, that the
window-place in the parlour (which was on a level with the street-door) was
ornamented by a glass case containing stuffed birds and surmounted by an
alabaster Cupid. He was sufficiently versed in his London to know that the
descent in the scale of the gentility was almost immeasurable for a person who
should have moved into that quarter from the neighbourhood of Park Lane. The
street was not squalid, and it was strictly residential; but it was mean and
meagre and fourth-rate, and had in the highest degree that paltry, parochial
air, that absence of style and elevation, which is the stamp of whole districts
of London and which Hyacinth had already more than once mentally compared with
the high-piled, important look of the Parisian perspective. It possessed in
combination every quality which should have made it detestable to the Princess;
it was almost as bad as Lomax Place. As they stopped before the narrow,
ill-painted door, on which the number of the house was marked with a piece of
common porcelain, cut in a fanciful shape, it appeared to Hyacinth that he had
felt, in their long walk, the touch of the passion which led his companion to
divest herself of her superfluities, but that it would take the romantic out of
one&rsquo;s heroism to settle one&rsquo;s self in such a <i>mesquin</i>,
Philistine row. However, if the Princess had wished to mortify the flesh she
had chosen an effective means of doing so, and of mortifying the spirit as
well. The long light of the gray summer evening was still in the air, and
Madeira Crescent wore a soiled, dusty expression. A hand-organ droned in front
of a neighbouring house, and the cart of the local washerwoman, to which a
donkey was harnessed, was drawn up opposite. The local children, as well, were
dancing on the pavement, to the music of the organ, and the scene was surveyed,
from one of the windows, by a gentleman in a dirty dressing-gown, smoking a
pipe, who made Hyacinth think of Mr Micawber. The young man gave the Princess a
deep look, before they went into the house, and she smiled, as if she
understood everything that was passing in his mind.
</p>

<p>
The long, circuitous walk with her, from the far-away south of London, had been
strange and delightful; it reminded Hyacinth, more queerly than he could have
expressed, of some of the rambles he had taken on summer evenings with
Millicent Henning. It was impossible to resemble this young lady less than the
Princess resembled her, but in her enjoyment of her unwonted situation (she had
never before, on a summer&rsquo;s evening&mdash;to the best of Hyacinth&rsquo;s
belief, at least&mdash;lost herself in the unfashionable districts on the arm
of a seedy artisan) the distinguished personage exhibited certain coincidences
with the shop-girl. She stopped, as Millicent had done, to look into the
windows of vulgar establishments, and amused herself with picking out
abominable objects that she should like to possess; selecting them from a new
point of view, that of a reduced fortune and the domestic arrangements of the
&lsquo;lower middle class&rsquo;, deriving extreme diversion from the idea that
she now belonged to that aggrieved body. She was in a state of light, fresh,
sociable exhilaration which Hyacinth had hitherto, in the same degree, not seen
in her, and before they reached Madeira Crescent it had become clear to him
that her present phase was little more than a brilliant <i>tour de force</i>,
which he could not imagine her keeping up long, for the simple reason that
after the novelty and strangeness of the affair had passed away she would not
be able to endure the contact of so much that was common and ugly. For the
moment her discoveries in this line diverted her, as all discoveries did, and
she pretended to be sounding, in a scientific spirit&mdash;that of the social
philosopher, the student and critic of manners&mdash;the depths of British
Philistia. Hyacinth was struck, more than ever, with the fund of life that was
in her, the energy of feeling, the high, free, reckless spirit. These things
expressed themselves, as the couple proceeded, in a hundred sallies and droll
proposals, kindling the young man&rsquo;s pulses and making him conscious of
the joy with which, in any extravagance, he would bear her company to the
death. She appeared to him, at this moment, to be playing with life so
audaciously and defiantly that the end of it all would inevitably be some
violent catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
She desired exceedingly that Hyacinth should take her to a music-hall or a
coffee-tavern; she even professed a curiosity to see the inside of a
public-house. As she still had self-possession enough to remember that if she
stayed out beyond a certain hour Madame Grandoni would begin to worry about
her, they were obliged to content themselves with the minor &lsquo;lark&rsquo;,
as the Princess was careful to designate their peep into an establishment,
glittering with polished pewter and brass, which bore the name of the
&lsquo;Happy Land&rsquo;. Hyacinth had feared that she would be nervous after
the narrow, befingered door had swung behind her, or that, at all events, she
would be disgusted at what she might see and hear in such a place and would
immediately wish to retreat. By good luck, however, there were only two or
three convivial spirits in occupancy, and the presence of the softer sex was
apparently not so rare as to excite surprise. The softer sex, furthermore, was
embodied in a big, hard, red woman, the publican&rsquo;s wife, who looked as if
she were in the habit of dealing with all sorts and mainly interested in seeing
whether even the finest put down their money before they were served. The
Princess pretended to &lsquo;have something&rsquo;, and to admire the
ornamentation of the bar; and when Hyacinth asked her in a low tone what
disposal they should make, when the great changes came, of such an embarrassing
type as that, replied, off-hand, &ldquo;Oh, drown her in a barrel of
beer!&rdquo; She professed, when they came out, to have been immensely
interested in the &lsquo;Happy Land&rsquo;, and was not content until Hyacinth
had fixed an evening on which they might visit a music-hall together. She
talked with him, largely, by fits and starts, about his adventures abroad and
his impressions of France and Italy; breaking off, suddenly, with some
irrelevant but almost extravagantly appreciative allusion to Rose Muniment and
Lady Aurora; then returning with a question as to what he had seen and done,
the answer to which, however, in many cases, she was not at pains to wait for.
Yet it implied that she had paid considerable attention to what he told her
that she should be able to say, towards the end, with that fraternising
frankness which was always touching because it appeared to place her at
one&rsquo;s mercy, to show that she counted on one&rsquo;s having an equal
loyalty, &ldquo;Well, my dear friend, you have not wasted your time; you know
everything, you have missed nothing; there are lots of things you can tell me,
and we shall have some famous talks in the winter evenings.&rdquo; This last
reference was apparently to the coming season, and there was something in the
tone of quiet friendship with which it was uttered, and which seemed to involve
so many delightful things, something that, for Hyacinth, bound them still
closer together. To live out of the world with her that way, lost among the
London millions, in a queer little cockneyfied retreat, was a refinement of
intimacy, and better even than the splendid chance he had enjoyed at Medley.
</p>

<p>
They found Madame Grandoni sitting alone in the twilight, very patient and
peaceful, and having, after all, it was clear, accepted the situation too
completely to fidget at such a trifle as her companion&rsquo;s not coming home
at a ladylike hour. She had placed herself in the back part of the tawdry
little drawing-room, which looked into a small, smutty garden, and from the
front window, which was open, the sound of the hurdy-gurdy and the voices of
the children, who were romping to its music, came in to her through the summer
dusk. The influence of London was there, in a kind of mitigated, far-away hum,
and for some reason or other, at that moment, the place, to Hyacinth, took on
the semblance of the home of an exile&mdash;a spot and an hour to be remembered
with a throb of fondness in some danger or sorrow of after years. The old lady
never moved from her chair as she saw the Princess come in with the little
bookbinder, and her eyes rested on Hyacinth as familiarly as if she had seen
him go out with her in the afternoon. The Princess stood before Madame Grandoni
a moment, smiling. &ldquo;I have done a great thing. What do you think I have
done?&rdquo; she asked, as she drew off her gloves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God knows! I have ceased to think!&rdquo; said the old woman, staring
up, with her fat, empty hands on the arms of her chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have come on foot from the far south of London&mdash;how many miles?
four or five&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not a particle tired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Che forza, che forza!</i>&rdquo; murmured Madame Grandoni. &ldquo;She
will knock you up, completely,&rdquo; she added, turning to Hyacinth with a
kind of customary compassion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor darling, <i>she</i> misses the carriage,&rdquo; Christina remarked,
passing out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni followed her with her eyes, and Hyacinth thought he perceived a
considerable lassitude, a plaintive bewilderment and <i>hébétement</i>, in the
old woman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like to use cabs&mdash;I mean
hansoms?&rdquo; he asked, wishing to say something comforting to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not true that I miss anything; my life is only too full,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;I lived worse than this&mdash;in my bad days.&rdquo; In a
moment she went on: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you are here&mdash;she
doesn&rsquo;t like Assunta to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Assunta&mdash;because I am here?&rdquo; Hyacinth did not immediately
catch her meaning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must have seen her Italian maid at Medley. She has kept her, and
she&rsquo;s ashamed of it. When we are alone Assunta comes for her bonnet. But
she likes you to think she waits on herself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a weakness&mdash;when she&rsquo;s so strong! And what does
Assunta think of it?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, looking at the stuffed birds in the
window, the alabaster Cupid, the wax flowers on the chimney-piece, the florid
antimacassars on the chairs, the sentimental engravings on the walls&mdash;in
frames of <i>papier-mâché</i> and &lsquo;composition&rsquo;, some of them
enveloped in pink tissue-paper&mdash;and the prismatic glass pendants which
seemed attached to everything.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says, &lsquo;What on earth will it matter to-morrow?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does she mean that to-morrow the Princess will have her luxury back
again? Hasn&rsquo;t she sold all her beautiful things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni was silent a moment. &ldquo;She has kept a few. They are put
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>A la bonne heure!</i>&rdquo; cried Hyacinth, laughing. He sat down
with the ironical old woman; he spent nearly half an hour in desultory
conversation with her, before candles were brought in, and while Christina was
in Assunta&rsquo;s hands. He noticed how resolutely the Princess had withheld
herself from any attempt to sweeten the dose she had taken it into her head to
swallow, to mitigate the ugliness of her vulgar little house. She had respected
its horrible idiosyncrasies, and left, rigidly, in their places the gimcracks
which found favour in Madeira Crescent. She had flung no draperies over the
pretentious furniture and disposed no rugs upon the staring carpet; and it was
plainly her theory that the right way to acquaint one&rsquo;s self with the
sensations of the wretched was to suffer the anguish of exasperated taste.
Presently a female servant came in&mdash;not the sceptical Assunta, but a
stunted young woman of the maid-of-all-work type, the same who had opened the
door to the pair a short time before&mdash;and informed Hyacinth that the
Princess wished him to understand that he was expected to remain to tea. He
learned from Madame Grandoni that the custom of an early dinner, followed in
the evening by the frugal repast of the lower orders, was another of
Christina&rsquo;s mortifications; and when, shortly afterwards, he saw the
table laid in the back parlour, which was also the dining-room, and observed
the nature of the crockery with which it was decorated, he perceived that
whether or no her earnestness were durable, it was at any rate, for the time,
intense. Madame Grandoni narrated to him, definitely, as the Princess had done
only in scraps, the history of the two ladies since his departure from Medley,
their relinquishment of that fine house and the sudden arrangements Christina
had made to change her mode of life, after they had been only ten days in South
Street. At the climax of the London season, in a society which only desired to
treat her as one of its brightest ornaments, she had retired to Madeira
Crescent, concealing her address (with only partial success, of course) from
every one, and inviting a celebrated curiosity-monger to come and look at her
<i>bibelots</i> and tell her what he would give her for the lot. In this manner
she had parted with them at a fearful sacrifice. She had wished to avoid the
nine days&rsquo; wonder of a public sale; for, to do her justice, though she
liked to be original she didn&rsquo;t like to be notorious, an occasion of
vulgar chatter. What had precipitated her determination was a remonstrance
received from her husband, just after she left Medley, on the subject of her
excessive expenditure; he had written to her that it was past a joke (as she
had appeared to consider it), and that she must really pull up. Nothing could
gall her more than an interference on that head (she maintained that she knew
the exact figure of the Prince&rsquo;s income, and that her allowance was an
insignificant part of it), and she had pulled up with a vengeance, as Hyacinth
perceived. The young man divined on this occasion one of the Princess&rsquo;s
sharpest anxieties (he had never thought of it before), the danger of
Casamassima&rsquo;s really putting the screw on&mdash;attempting to make her
come back and live with him by withholding supplies altogether. In this case
she would find herself in a very tight place, though she had a theory that if
she should go to law about the matter the courts would allow her a separate
maintenance. This course, however, it would scarcely be in her character to
adopt; she would be more likely to waive her right and support herself by
lessons in music and the foreign tongues, supplemented by the remnant of
property that had come to her from her mother. That she was capable of
returning to the Prince some day, through not daring to face the loss of
luxury, was an idea that could not occur to Hyacinth, in the midst of her
assurances, uttered at various times, that she positively yearned for a
sacrifice; and such an apprehension was less present to him than ever as he
listened to Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s account of the manner in which her rupture
with the fashionable world had been effected. It must be added that the old
lady remarked, with a sigh, that she didn&rsquo;t know how it would all end, as
some of Christina&rsquo;s economies were very costly; and when Hyacinth pressed
her a little she went on to say that it was not at present the question of
complications arising from the Prince that troubled her most, but the fear that
Christina was seriously compromised by her reckless, senseless
correspondences&mdash;letters arriving from foreign countries, from God knew
whom (Christina never told her, nor did she desire it), all about uprisings and
liberations (of so much one could be sure) and other matters that were no
concern of honest folk. Hyacinth scarcely knew what Madame Grandoni meant by
this allusion, which seemed to show that, during the last few months, the
Princess had considerably extended her revolutionary connection: he only
thought of Hoffendahl, whose name, however, he was careful not to pronounce,
and wondered whether his hostess had been writing to the Master to intercede
for <i>him</i>, to beg that he might be let off. His cheeks burned at the
thought, but he contented himself with remarking to Madame Grandoni that their
extraordinary friend enjoyed the sense of danger. The old lady wished to know
how she would enjoy the hangman&rsquo;s rope (with which, <i>du train dont elle
allait</i>, she might easily make acquaintance); and when he expressed the hope
that she didn&rsquo;t regard him as a counsellor of imprudence, replied,
&ldquo;You, my poor child? Oh, I saw into you at Medley. You are a simple
<i>codino!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess came in to tea in a very dull gown, with a bunch of keys at her
girdle; and nothing could have suggested the thrifty housewife better than the
manner in which she superintended the laying of the cloth and the placing on it
of a little austere refreshment&mdash;a pile of bread and butter, flanked by a
pot of marmalade and a morsel of bacon. She filled the teapot out of a little
tin canister locked up in a cupboard, of which the key worked with difficulty,
and made the tea with her own superb hands; taking pains, however, to explain
to Hyacinth that she was far from imposing that régime on Madame Grandoni, who
understood that the grocer had a standing order to supply her, for her private
consumption, with any delicacy she might desire. For herself, she had never
been so well as since she had followed a homely diet. On Sundays they had
muffins, and sometimes, for a change, a smoked haddock, or even a fried sole.
Hyacinth was lost in adoration of the Princess&rsquo;s housewifely ways and of
the exquisite figure that she made as a little <i>bourgeoise;</i> judging that
if her attempt to combine plain living with high thinking were all a comedy, at
least it was the most finished entertainment she had yet offered him. She
talked to Madame Grandoni about Lady Aurora; described her with much drollery,
even to the details of her dress; declared that she was a delightful creature
and one of the most interesting persons she had seen for an age; expressed to
Hyacinth the conviction that she should like her exceedingly, if Lady Aurora
would only believe a little in <i>her</i>. &ldquo;But I shall like her, whether
she does or not,&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;I always know when
that&rsquo;s going to happen; it isn&rsquo;t so common. She will begin very
well with me, and be &lsquo;fascinated&rsquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the way
people begin with me?&mdash;but she won&rsquo;t understand me at all, or make
out in the least what kind of a queer fish I am, though I shall try to show
her. When she thinks she does, at last, she will give me up in disgust, and
will never know that she has understood me quite wrong. That has been the way
with most of the people I have liked; they have run away from me <i>à toutes
jambes</i>. Oh, I have inspired aversions!&rdquo; laughed the Princess, handing
Hyacinth his cup of tea. He recognised it by the aroma as a mixture not
inferior to that of which he had partaken at Medley. &ldquo;I have never
succeeded in knowing any one who would do me good; for by the time I began to
improve, under their influence, they could put up with me no longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You told me you were going to visit the poor. I don&rsquo;t understand
what your Gräfin was doing there,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She had come out of charity&mdash;in the same way as I. She evidently
goes about immensely over there; I shall entreat her to take me with
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you had promised to let me be your guide, in those
explorations,&rdquo; Hyacinth remarked.
</p>

<p>
The Princess looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Dear Mr Robinson, Lady Aurora knows
more than you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There have been times, surely, when you have complimented me on my
knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I mean more about the lower classes!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed;
and, oddly enough, there was a sense in which Hyacinth was unable to deny the
allegation. He presently returned to something she had said a moment before,
declaring that it had not been the way with Madame Grandoni and him to take to
their heels, and to this she replied, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll run away yet;
don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that if I had been capable of quitting you I should have done it
by this time; I have neglected such opportunities,&rdquo; the old lady sighed.
Hyacinth now perceived that her eye had quite lost its ancient twinkle; she was
troubled about many things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true that if you didn&rsquo;t leave me when I was rich, it
wouldn&rsquo;t look well for you to leave me at present,&rdquo; the Princess
suggested; and before Madame Grandoni could reply to this speech she said to
Hyacinth, &ldquo;I liked the man, your friend Muniment, so much for saying he
wouldn&rsquo;t come to see me. &lsquo;What good would it do him,&rsquo; poor
fellow? What good would it do him, indeed? You were not so difficult: you held
off a little and pleaded obstacles, but one could see you would come
down,&rdquo; she continued, covering her guest with her mystifying smile.
&ldquo;Besides, I was smarter then, more splendid; I had on gewgaws and
suggested worldly lures. I must have been more attractive. But I liked him for
refusing,&rdquo; she repeated; and of the many words she uttered that evening
it was these that made most impression on Hyacinth. He remained for an hour
after tea, for on rising from the table she had gone to the piano (she had not
deprived herself of this resource, and had a humble instrument, of the
so-called &lsquo;cottage&rsquo; kind) and begun to play in a manner that
reminded him of her playing the day of his arrival at Medley. The night had
grown close, and as the piano was in the front room he opened, at her request,
the window that looked into Madeira Crescent. Beneath it assembled the youth of
both sexes, the dingy loiterers who had clustered an hour before around the
hurdy-gurdy. But on this occasion they did not caper about; they remained
still, leaning against the area-rails and listening to the wondrous music. When
Hyacinth told the Princess of the spell she had thrown upon them she declared
that it made her singularly happy; she added that she was really glad, almost
proud, of her day; she felt as if she had begun to do something for the people.
Just before he took leave she encountered some occasion for saying to him that
she was certain the man in Audley Court wouldn&rsquo;t come; and Hyacinth
forbore contradict her, because he believed that in fact he wouldn&rsquo;t.

<h3><a name="chap34"></a>XXXIV</h3>

<p>
How right she had been to say that Lady Aurora would probably be fascinated at
first was proved the first time Hyacinth went to Belgrave Square, a visit he
was led to pay very promptly, by a deep sense of the obligations under which
her ladyship had placed him at the time of Pinnie&rsquo;s death. The
circumstances in which he found her were quite the same as those of his visit
the year before; she was spending the unfashionable season in her
father&rsquo;s empty house, amid a desert of brown holland and the dormant
echoes of heavy conversation. He had seen so much of her during Pinnie&rsquo;s
illness that he felt (or had felt then) that he knew her almost
intimately&mdash;that they had become real friends, almost comrades, and might
meet henceforth without reserves or ceremonies; yet she was as fluttered and
awkward as she had been on the other occasion: not distant, but entangled in
new coils of shyness and apparently unmindful of what had happened to draw them
closer. Hyacinth, however, always liked extremely to be with her, for she was
the person in the world who quietly, delicately, and as a matter of course
treated him most like a gentleman. She had never said the handsome, flattering
things to him that had fallen from the lips of the Princess, and never
explained to him her view of him; but her timid, cursory, receptive manner,
which took all sorts of equalities for granted, was a homage to the idea of his
refinement. It was in this manner that she now conversed with him on the
subject of his foreign travels; he found himself discussing the political
indications of Paris and the Ruskinian theories of Venice, in Belgrave Square,
quite like one of the cosmopolites bred in that region. It took him, however,
but a few minutes to perceive that Lady Aurora&rsquo;s heart was not in these
considerations; the deferential smile she bent upon him, while she sat with her
head thrust forward and her long hands clasped in her lap, was slightly
mechanical, her attitude perfunctory. When he gave her his views of some of the
<i>arrière-pensées</i> of <i>M. Gambetta</i> (for he had views not altogether,
as he thought, deficient in originality), she did not interrupt, for she never
interrupted; but she took advantage of his first pause to say, quickly,
irrelevantly, &ldquo;Will the Princess Casamassima come again to Audley
Court?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt she will come again, if they would like her to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do hope she will. She is very wonderful,&rdquo; Lady Aurora continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, she is very wonderful. I think she gave Rosy pleasure,&rdquo;
said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rosy can talk of nothing else. It would really do her great good to see
the Princess again. Don&rsquo;t you think she is different from anybody that
one has ever seen?&rdquo; But her ladyship added, before waiting for an answer
to this, &ldquo;I liked her quite extraordinarily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She liked you just as much. I know it would give her great pleasure if
you should go to see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Aurora; but she instantly obtained the
Princess&rsquo;s address from Hyacinth, and made a note of it in a small,
shabby book. She mentioned that the card the Princess had given her in
Camberwell proved to contain no address, and Hyacinth recognised that
vagary&mdash;the Princess was so off-hand. Then she said, hesitating a little,
&ldquo;Does she really care for the poor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the young man replied, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine what interest she has in pretending to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she does, she&rsquo;s very remarkable&mdash;she deserves great
honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You really care; why is she more remarkable than you?&rdquo; Hyacinth
demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very different&mdash;she&rsquo;s so wonderfully
attractive!&rdquo; Lady Aurora replied, making, recklessly, the only allusion
to the oddity of her own appearance in which Hyacinth was destined to hear her
indulge. She became conscious of it the moment she had spoken, and said,
quickly, to turn it off, &ldquo;I should like to talk with her, but I&rsquo;m
rather afraid. She&rsquo;s tremendously clever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, what she is you&rsquo;ll find out when you know her!&rdquo; Hyacinth
sighed, expressively.
</p>

<p>
His hostess looked at him a little, and then, vaguely, exclaimed, &ldquo;How
very interesting!&rdquo; The next moment she continued, &ldquo;She might do so
many other things; she might charm the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She does that, whatever she does,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all by the way; it needn&rsquo;t interfere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean, that most other people would be
content&mdash;beautiful as she is. There&rsquo;s great merit, when you give up
something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has known a great many bad people, and she wants to know some
good,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined. &ldquo;Therefore be sure to go to her
soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She looks as if she had known nothing bad since she was born,&rdquo;
said Lady Aurora, rapturously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine her going into all
the dreadful places that she would have to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have gone into them, and it hasn&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Hyacinth
suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know that? My family think it has.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You make me glad that I haven&rsquo;t a family,&rdquo; said the young
man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the Princess&mdash;has she no one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, she has a husband. But she doesn&rsquo;t live with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he one of the bad persons?&rdquo; asked Lady Aurora, as earnestly as
a child listening to a tale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like to abuse him, because he is down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I were a man, I should be in love with her,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora.
Then she pursued, &ldquo;I wonder whether we might work together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what she hopes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t show her the worst places,&rdquo; said her ladyship,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
To which Hyacinth replied, &ldquo;I suspect you will do what every one else has
done, namely, exactly what she wants!&rdquo; Before he took leave he said to
her, &ldquo;Do you know whether Paul Muniment liked the Princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora meditated a moment, apparently with some intensity. &ldquo;I think
he considered her extraordinarily beautiful&mdash;the most beautiful person he
had ever seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does he still believe her to be a humbug?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still?&rdquo; asked Lady Aurora, as if she didn&rsquo;t understand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that that was the impression apparently made upon him last winter
by my description of her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure he thinks her tremendously plucky!&rdquo; That was
all the satisfaction Hyacinth got just then as to Muniment&rsquo;s estimate of
the Princess.
</p>

<p>
A few days afterward he returned to Madeira Crescent, in the evening, the only
time he was free, the Princess having given him a general invitation to take
tea with her. He felt that he ought to be discreet in acting upon it, though he
was not without reasons that would have warranted him in going early and often.
He had a peculiar dread of her growing tired of him&mdash;boring herself in his
society; yet at the same time he had rather a sharp vision of her boring
herself without him, in the dull summer evenings, when even Paddington was out
of town. He wondered what she did, what visitors dropped in, what pastimes she
cultivated, what saved her from the sudden vagary of throwing up the whole of
her present game. He remembered that there was a complete side of her life with
which he was almost unacquainted (Lady Marchant and her daughters, at Medley,
and three or four other persons who had called while he was there, being, in
his experience, the only illustrations of it), and knew not to what extent she
had, in spite of her transformation, preserved relations with her old friends;
but he could easily imagine a day when she should discover that what she found
in Madeira Crescent was less striking than what she missed. Going thither a
second time Hyacinth perceived that he had done her great injustice; she was
full of resources, she had never been so happy, she found time to read, to
write, to commune with her piano, and above all to think&mdash;a delightful
detachment from the invasive, vulgar, gossiping, distracting world she had
known hitherto. The only interruption to her felicity was that she received
quantities of notes from her former acquaintance, challenging her to give some
account of herself, to say what had become of her, to come and stay with them
in the country; but with these importunate missives she took a very short
way&mdash;she simply burned them, without answering. She told Hyacinth
immediately that Lady Aurora had called on her, two days before, at an hour
when she was not in, and she had straightway addressed her, in return, an
invitation to come to tea, any evening, at eight o&rsquo;clock. That was the
way the people in Madeira Crescent entertained each other (the Princess knew
everything about them now, and was eager to impart her knowledge); and the
evening, she was sure, would be much more convenient to Lady Aurora, whose days
were filled with good works, peregrinations of charity. Her ladyship arrived
ten minutes after Hyacinth; she told the Princess that her invitation had been
expressed in a manner so irresistible that she was unwilling to wait more than
a day to respond. She was introduced to Madame Grandoni, and tea was
immediately served; Hyacinth being gratefully conscious the while of the
super-subtle way in which Lady Aurora forbore to appear bewildered at meeting
him in such society. She knew he frequented it, and she had been witness of his
encounter with the Princess in Audley Court; but it might have startled her to
have ocular evidence of the footing on which he stood. Everything the Princess
did or said, at this time, had for effect, whatever its purpose, to make her
seem more rare and fine; and she had seldom given him greater pleasure than by
the exquisite art she put forward to win Lady Aurora&rsquo;s confidence, to
place herself under the pure and elevating influence of the noble spinster. She
made herself small and simple; she spoke of her own little aspirations and
efforts; she appealed and persuaded; she laid her white hand on Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s, gazing at her with an interest which was evidently deeply
sincere, but which, all the same, derived half its effect from the contrast
between the quality of her beauty, the whole air of her person, and the hard,
dreary problems of misery and crime. It was touching, and Lady Aurora was
touched; that was very evident as they sat together on the sofa, after tea, and
the Princess protested that she only wanted to know what her new friend was
doing&mdash;what she had done for years&mdash;in order that she might go and do
likewise. She asked personal questions with a directness that was sometimes
embarrassing to the subject&mdash;Hyacinth had seen that habit in her from the
first&mdash;and Lady Aurora, though she was charmed and excited, was not quite
comfortable at being so publicly probed and sounded. The public was formed of
Madame Grandoni and Hyacinth; but the old lady (whose intercourse with the
visitor had consisted almost wholly of watching her with a quiet, speculative
anxiety) presently shuffled away, and was heard, through the thin partitions
that prevailed in Madeira Crescent, to ascend to her own apartment. It seemed
to Hyacinth that he ought also, in delicacy, to retire, and this was his
intention, from one moment to the other; to him, certainly (and the second time
she met him), Lady Aurora had made as much of her confession as he had a right
to look for. After that one little flash of egotism he had never again heard
her allude to her own feelings or circumstances.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you stay in town, like this, at such a season, on purpose to attend
to your work?&rdquo; the Princess asked; and there was something archly rueful
in the tone in which she made this inquiry, as if it cost her just a pang to
find that in taking such a line she herself had not been so original as she
hoped. &ldquo;Mr Robinson has told me about your big house in Belgrave
Square&mdash;you must let me come and see you there. Nothing would make me so
happy as that you should allow me to help you a little&mdash;how little soever.
Do you like to be helped, or do you like to go alone? Are you very independent,
or do you need to look up, to cling, to lean upon some one? Excuse me if I ask
impertinent questions; we speak that way&mdash;rather, you know&mdash;in Rome,
where I have spent a large part of my life. That idea of your being there alone
in your great dull house, with all your charities and devotions, makes a kind
of picture in my mind; it&rsquo;s quaint and touching, like something in some
English novel. Englishwomen are so accomplished, are they not? I am really a
foreigner, you know, and though I have lived here a while it takes one some
time to find those things out <i>au juste</i>. Therefore, is your work for the
people only one of your occupations, or is it everything, does it absorb your
whole life? That&rsquo;s what I should like it to be for me! Do your family
like you to throw yourself into all this, or have you had to brave a certain
amount of ridicule? I dare say you have; that&rsquo;s where you English are
strong, in braving ridicule. They have to do it so often, haven&rsquo;t they? I
don&rsquo;t know whether I could do it. I never tried; but with you I would
brave anything. Are your family clever and sympathetic? No? the kind of thing
that one&rsquo;s family generally is? Ah, well, dear lady, we must make a
little family together. Are you encouraged or disgusted? Do you go on doggedly,
or have you any faith, any great idea, that lifts you up? Are you religious,
now, <i>par exemple?</i> Do you do your work in connection with any
ecclesiasticism, any missions, or priests or sisters? I&rsquo;m a Catholic, you
know&mdash;but so little! I shouldn&rsquo;t mind in the least joining hands
with any one who is really doing anything. I express myself awkwardly, but
perhaps you know what I mean. Possibly you don&rsquo;t know that I am one of
those who believe that a great social cataclysm is destined to take place, and
that it can&rsquo;t make things worse than they are already. I believe, in a
word, in the people doing something for themselves (the others will never do
anything for them), and I am quite willing to help them. If that shocks you I
shall be immensely disappointed, because there is something in the impression
you make on me that seems to say that you haven&rsquo;t the usual prejudices,
and that if certain things were to happen you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid. You are
shy, are you not?&mdash;but you are not timorous. I suppose that if you thought
the inequalities and oppressions and miseries which now exist were a necessary
part of life, and were going on for ever, you wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in
those people over the river (the bedridden girl and her brother, I mean);
because Mr Robinson tells me that they are advanced socialists&mdash;or at
least the brother is. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll say that you don&rsquo;t care for
him; the sister, to your mind, being the remarkable one. She is, indeed, a
perfect little <i>femme du monde</i>&mdash;she talks so much better than most
of the people in society. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind my saying that, because I
have an idea that you are not in society. You can imagine whether I am!
Haven&rsquo;t you judged it, like me, condemned it, and given it up? Are you
not sick of the egotism, the snobbery, the meanness, the frivolity, the
immorality, the hypocrisy? Isn&rsquo;t there a great resemblance in our
situation? I don&rsquo;t mean in our nature, for you are far better than I
shall ever be. Aren&rsquo;t you quite divinely good? When I see a woman of your
sort (not that I often do!) I try to be a little less bad. You have helped
hundreds, thousands, of people; you must help me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These remarks, which I have strung together, did not, of course, fall from the
Princess&rsquo;s lips in an uninterrupted stream; they were arrested and
interspersed by frequent inarticulate responses and embarrassed protests. Lady
Aurora shrank from them even while they gratified her, blinking and fidgeting
in the brilliant, direct light of her hostess&rsquo;s attentions. I need not
repeat her answers, the more so as they none of them arrived at completion, but
passed away into nervous laughter and averted looks, the latter directed at the
ceiling, the floor, the windows, and appearing to constitute a kind of entreaty
to some occult or supernatural power that the conversation should become more
impersonal. In reply to the Princess&rsquo;s allusion to the convictions
prevailing in the Muniment family, she said that the brother and sister thought
differently about public questions, but were of the same mind with regard to
persons of the upper class taking an interest in the working people, attempting
to enter into their life: they held it was a great mistake. At this information
the Princess looked much disappointed; she wished to know if the Muniments
thought it was impossible to do them any good. &ldquo;Oh, I mean a mistake from
<i>our</i> point of view,&rdquo; said Lady Aurora. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t
do it in our place; they think we had much better occupy ourselves with our own
pleasures.&rdquo; And as the Princess stared, not comprehending, she went on:
&ldquo;Rosy thinks we have a right to our own pleasures under all
circumstances, no matter how badly off the poor may be; and her brother takes
the ground that we will not have them long, and that in view of what may happen
we are great fools not to make the most of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see, I see. That is very strong,&rdquo; the Princess murmured, in a
tone of high appreciation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say. But all the same, whatever is going to come, one <i>must</i>
do something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do think, then, that something is going to come?&rdquo; said the
Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, immense changes, I dare say. But I don&rsquo;t belong to anything,
you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated a moment. &ldquo;No more do I. But many people do. Mr
Robinson, for instance.&rdquo; And she gave Hyacinth a familiar smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if the changes depend on me!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed,
blushing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t set the Thames on fire&mdash;I quite agree to
that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lady Aurora had the manner of not considering that she had a warrant for going
into the question of Hyacinth&rsquo;s affiliations; so she stared abstractly at
the piano and in a moment remarked to the Princess, &ldquo;I am sure you play
awfully well; I should like so much to hear you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth felt that their hostess thought this <i>banal</i>. She had not asked
Lady Aurora to spend the evening with her simply that they should fall back on
the resources of the vulgar. Nevertheless, she replied with perfect good-nature
that she should be delighted to play; only there was a thing she should like
much better, namely, that Lady Aurora should narrate her life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk about mine; yours, yours!&rdquo; her ladyship
cried, colouring with eagerness and, for the first time since her arrival,
indulging in the free gesture of laying her hand upon that of the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With so many narratives in the air, I certainly had better take myself
off,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, and the Princess offered no opposition to his
departure. She and Lady Aurora were evidently on the point of striking up a
tremendous intimacy, and as he turned this idea over, walking away, it made him
sad, for strange, vague reasons, which he could not have expressed.

<h3><a name="chap35"></a>XXXV</h3>

<p>
The Sunday following this occasion Hyacinth spent almost entirely with the
Muniments, with whom, since his return to his work, he had been able to have no
long, fraternising talk, of the kind that had marked their earlier relations.
The present, however, was a happy day; it refreshed exceedingly the sentiments
with which he now regarded the inscrutable Paul. The warm, bright September
weather gilded even the dinginess of Audley Court, and while, in the morning,
Rosy&rsquo;s brother and their visitor sat beside her sofa, the trio amused
themselves with discussing a dozen different plans for giving a festive turn to
the day. There had been moments, in the last six months, when Hyacinth had the
sense that he should never again be able to enter into such ideas as that, and
these moments had been connected with the strange perversion taking place in
his mental image of the man whose hardness (of course he was obliged to be
hard) he had never expected to see turned upon a passionate admirer. But now,
for the hour at least, the darkness had cleared away, and Paul&rsquo;s company
was in itself a comfortable, inspiring influence. He had never been kinder,
jollier, safer, as it were; it had never appeared more desirable to hold fast
to him and trust him. Less than ever would an observer have guessed there was a
reason why the two young men might have winced as they looked at each other.
Rosy naturally took part in the question debated between her
companions&mdash;the question whether they should limit their excursion to a
walk in Hyde Park; should embark at Lambeth pier on the penny steamer, which
would convey them to Greenwich; or should start presently for Waterloo station
and go thence by train to Hampton Court. Miss Muniment had visited none of
these places, but she contributed largely to the discussion, for which she
seemed perfectly qualified; talked about the crowd on the steamer, and the
inconvenience arising from drunken persons on the return, quite as if she had
suffered from these drawbacks; said that the view from the hill at Greenwich
was terribly smoky, and at that season the fashionable world&mdash;half the
attraction, of course&mdash;was wholly absent from Hyde Park; and expressed
strong views in favour of Wolsey&rsquo;s old palace, with whose history she
appeared intimately acquainted. She threw herself into her brother&rsquo;s
holiday with eagerness and glee, and Hyacinth marvelled again at the stoicism
of the hard, bright creature, polished, as it were, by pain, whose imagination
appeared never to concern itself with her own privations, so that she could lie
in her close little room the whole golden afternoon, without bursting into sobs
as she saw the western sunbeams slant upon the shabby, ugly, familiar paper of
her wall and thought of the far-off fields and gardens which she should never
see. She talked immensely of the Princess, for whose beauty, grace and
benevolence she could find no sufficient praise; declaring that of all the fair
faces that had ever hung over her couch (and Rosy spoke as from immense
opportunities for comparison) she had far the noblest and most refreshing. She
seemed to make a kind of light in the room and to leave it behind her after she
had gone. Rosy could call up her image as she could hum a tune she had heard,
and she expressed in her quaint, particular way how, as she lay there in the
quiet hours, she repeated over to herself the beautiful air. The Princess might
be anything, she might be royal or imperial, and Rosy was well aware how little
<i>she</i> should complain of the dullness of her life when such apparitions as
that could pop in any day. She made a difference in the place&mdash;it gave it
a kind of finish for her to have come there; if it was good enough for a
princess, it was good enough for <i>her</i>, and she hoped she shouldn&rsquo;t
hear again of Paul&rsquo;s wishing her to move out of a room with which she
should have henceforth such delightful associations. The Princess had found her
way to Audley Court, and perhaps she wouldn&rsquo;t find it to another
lodging&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t expect her to follow them about London at
their pleasure; and at any rate she had evidently been very much struck with
the little room, so that if they were quiet and patient who could say but the
fancy would take her to send them a bit of carpet, or a picture, or even a
mirror with a gilt frame, to make it a bit more tasteful? Rosy&rsquo;s
transitions from pure enthusiasm to the imaginative calculation of benefit were
performed with a serenity peculiar to herself. Her chatter had so much spirit
and point that it always commanded attention, but to-day Hyacinth was less
tolerant of it than usual, because so long as it lasted Muniment held his
tongue, and what he had been anxious about was much more Paul&rsquo;s
impression of the Princess. Rosy made no remark to him on the monopoly he had
so long enjoyed of this wonderful lady; she had always had the manner of a kind
of indulgent incredulity about Hyacinth&rsquo;s social adventures, and he saw
the day might easily come when she would begin to talk of the Princess as if
she herself had been the first to discover her. She had much to say, however,
about the nature of the acquaintance Lady Aurora had formed with her, and she
was mainly occupied with the glory she had drawn upon herself by bringing two
such exalted persons together. She fancied them alluding, in the great world,
to the occasion on which &lsquo;we first met, at Miss Muniment&rsquo;s, you
know&rsquo;; and she related how Lady Aurora, who had been in Audley Court the
day before, had declared that she owed her a debt she could never repay. The
two ladies had liked each other more, almost, than they liked any one; and
wasn&rsquo;t it a rare picture to think of them moving hand in hand, like twin
roses, through the bright upper air? Muniment inquired, in rather a coarse,
unsympathetic way, what the mischief she ever wanted of <i>her;</i> which led
Hyacinth to demand in return, &ldquo;What do you mean? What does who want of
whom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does the beauty want of <i>our</i> poor lady? She has a totally
different stamp. I don&rsquo;t know much about women, but I can see
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;a different stamp? They both have the stamp of
their rank!&rdquo; cried Rosy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who can ever tell what women want, at any time?&rdquo; Hyacinth said,
with the off-handedness of a man of the world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my boy, if you don&rsquo;t know any more than I, you disappoint
me! Perhaps if we wait long enough she will tell us some day herself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell you what she wants of Lady Aurora?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind about Lady Aurora so much; but what in the name of
long journeys does she want with <i>us?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re worth a long journey?&rdquo; Rosy
asked, gaily. &ldquo;If you were not my brother, which is handy for seeing you,
and I were not confined to my sofa, I would go from one end of England to the
other to make your acquaintance! He&rsquo;s in love with the Princess,&rdquo;
she went on, to Hyacinth, &ldquo;and he asks those senseless questions to cover
it up. What does any one want of anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was decided, at last, that the two young men should go down to Greenwich,
and after they had partaken of bread and cheese with Rosy they embarked on a
penny steamer. The boat was densely crowded, and they leaned, rather squeezed
together, in the fore part of it, against the rail of the deck, and watched the
big black fringe of the yellow stream. The river was always fascinating to
Hyacinth. The mystified entertainment which, as a child, he had found in all
the aspects of London came back to him from the murky scenery of its banks and
the sordid agitation of its bosom: the great arches and pillars of the bridges,
where the water rushed, and the funnels tipped, and sounds made an echo, and
there seemed an overhanging of interminable processions; the miles of ugly
wharves and warehouses; the lean protrusions of chimney, mast, and crane; the
painted signs of grimy industries, staring from shore to shore; the strange,
flat, obstructive barges, straining and bumping on some business as to which
everything was vague but that it was remarkably dirty; the clumsy coasters and
colliers, which thickened as one went down; the small, loafing boats, whose
occupants, somehow, looking up from their oars at the steamer, as they rocked
in the oily undulations of its wake, appeared profane and sarcastic; in short,
all the grinding, puffing, smoking, splashing activity of the turbid flood. In
the good-natured crowd, amid the fumes of vile tobacco, beneath the shower of
sooty particles, and to the accompaniment of a bagpipe of a dingy Highlander,
who sketched occasionally a smothered reel, Hyacinth forbore to speak to his
companion of what he had most at heart; but later, as they lay on the brown,
crushed grass, on one of the slopes of Greenwich Park, and saw the river
stretch away and shine beyond the pompous colonnades of the hospital, he asked
him whether there was any truth in what Rosy had said about his being sweet on
their friend the Princess. He said &lsquo;their friend&rsquo; on purpose,
speaking as if, now that she had been twice to Audley Court, Muniment might be
regarded as knowing her almost as well as he himself did. He wished to conjure
away the idea that he was jealous of Paul, and if he desired information on the
point I have mentioned this was because it still made him almost as
uncomfortable as it had done at first that his comrade should take the scoffing
view. He didn&rsquo;t easily see such a fellow as Muniment wheel about from one
day to the other, but he had been present at the most exquisite exhibition he
had ever observed the Princess make of that divine power of conciliation which
was not perhaps in social intercourse the art she chiefly exercised but was
certainly the most wonderful of her secrets, and it would be remarkable indeed
that a sane young man should not have been affected by it. It was familiar to
Hyacinth that Muniment was not easily touched by women, but this might
perfectly have been the case without detriment to the Princess&rsquo;s ability
to work a miracle. The companions had wandered through the great halls and
courts of the hospital; had gazed up at the glories of the famous painted
chamber and admired the long and lurid series of the naval victories of
England&mdash;Muniment remarking to his friend that he supposed he had seen the
match to all that in foreign parts, offensive little travelled beggar that he
was. They had not ordered a fish-dinner either at the &lsquo;Trafalgar&rsquo;
or the &lsquo;Ship&rsquo; (having a frugal vision of tea and shrimps with Rosy,
on their return), but they had laboured up and down the steep undulations of
the shabby, charming park; made advances to the tame deer and seen them amble
foolishly away; watched the young of both sexes, hilarious and red in the face,
roll in promiscuous entanglement over the slopes; gazed at the little brick
observatory, perched on one of the knolls, which sets the time of English
history and in which Hyacinth could see that his companion took a kind of
technical interest; wandered out of one of the upper gates and admired the
trimness of the little villas at Blackheath, where Muniment declared that it
was his idea of supreme social success to be able to live. He pointed out two
or three small, semi-detached houses, faced with stucco, and with
&lsquo;Mortimer Lodge&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Sycamores&rsquo; inscribed upon the
gate-posts, and Hyacinth guessed that these were the sort of place where he
would like to end his days&mdash;in high, pure air, with a genteel window for
Rosy&rsquo;s couch and a cheerful view of suburban excursions. It was when they
came back into the park that, being rather hot and a little satiated, they
stretched themselves under a tree and Hyacinth yielded to his curiosity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sweet on her&mdash;sweet on her, my boy!&rdquo; said Muniment. &ldquo;I
might as well be sweet on the dome of St Paul&rsquo;s, which I just make out
off there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The dome of St Paul&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t come to see you, and
doesn&rsquo;t ask you to return the visit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t return visits&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of jobs of my
own to do. If I don&rsquo;t put myself out for the Princess, isn&rsquo;t that a
sufficient answer to your question?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m by no means sure,&rdquo; said Hyacinth. &ldquo;If you went to
see her, simply and civilly, because she asked you, I shouldn&rsquo;t regard it
as a proof that you had taken a fancy to her. Your hanging off is more
suspicious; it may mean that you don&rsquo;t trust yourself&mdash;that you are
in danger of falling in love if you go in for a more intimate
acquaintance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rum job, your wanting me to make up to her. I
shouldn&rsquo;t think it would suit your book,&rdquo; Muniment rejoined,
staring at the sky, with his hands clasped under his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;m afraid of you?&rdquo; his companion asked.
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Hyacinth added in a moment, &ldquo;why the devil should
I care, now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment, for a little, made no rejoinder; he turned over on his side, and with
his arm resting on the ground leaned his head on his hand. Hyacinth felt his
eyes on his face, but he also felt himself colouring, and didn&rsquo;t meet
them. He had taken a private vow never to indulge, to Muniment, in certain
inauspicious references, and the words he had just spoken had slipped out of
his mouth too easily. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Paul demanded, at
last; and when Hyacinth looked at him he saw nothing but his companion&rsquo;s
strong, fresh, irresponsible face. Muniment, before speaking, had had time to
guess what he meant by it.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, an impulse that he had never known before, or rather that he had
always resisted, took possession of him. There was a mystery which it concerned
his happiness to clear up, and he became unconscious of his scruples, of his
pride, of the strength that he had believed to be in him&mdash;the strength for
going through his work and passing away without a look behind. He sat forward
on the grass, with his arms round his knees, and bent upon Muniment a face
lighted up by his difficulties. For a minute the two men&rsquo;s eyes met with
extreme clearness, and then Hyacinth exclaimed, &ldquo;What an extraordinary
fellow you are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it there!&rdquo; said Muniment, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make a scene, or work on your feelings, but how
will you like it when I&rsquo;m strung up on the gallows?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean for Hoffendahl&rsquo;s job? That&rsquo;s what you were alluding
to just now?&rdquo; Muniment lay there, in the same attitude, chewing a long
blade of dry grass, which he held to his lips with his free hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak of it; but after all, why shouldn&rsquo;t
it come up? Naturally, I have thought of it a good deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What good does that do?&rdquo; Muniment returned. &ldquo;I hoped you
didn&rsquo;t, and I noticed you never spoke of it. You don&rsquo;t like it; you
would rather throw it up,&rdquo; he added.
</p>

<p>
There was not in his voice the faintest note of irony or contempt, no sign
whatever that he passed judgment on such a tendency. He spoke in a quiet,
human, memorising manner, as if it had originally quite entered into his
thought to allow for weak regrets. Nevertheless the complete reasonableness of
his tone itself cast a chill on his companion&rsquo;s spirit; it was like the
touch of a hand at once very firm and very soft, but strangely cold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want in the least to throw the business up, but did you
suppose I liked it?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked, with rather a forced laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, how could I tell? You like a lot of things I
don&rsquo;t. You like excitement and emotion and change, you like remarkable
sensations, whereas I go in for a holy calm, for sweet repose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you object, for yourself, to change, and are so fond of still waters,
why have you associated yourself with a revolutionary movement?&rdquo; Hyacinth
demanded, with a little air of making rather a good point.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just for that reason!&rdquo; Muniment answered, with a smile.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t our revolutionary movement as quiet as the grave? Who knows,
who suspects, anything like the full extent of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see&mdash;you take only the quiet parts!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In speaking these words Hyacinth had had no derisive intention, but a moment
later he flushed with the sense that they had a sufficiently petty sound.
Muniment, however, appeared to see no offence in them, and it was in the
gentlest, most suggestive way, as if he had been thinking over what might
comfort his comrade, that he replied, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you ought
to remember&mdash;that it&rsquo;s quite on the cards it may never come
off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t desire that reminder,&rdquo; Hyacinth said; &ldquo;and,
moreover, you must let me say that, somehow, I don&rsquo;t easily fancy
<i>you</i> mixed up with things that don&rsquo;t come off. Anything you have to
do with will come off, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment reflected a moment, as if his little companion were charmingly
ingenious. &ldquo;Surely, I have nothing to do with this idea of
Hoffendahl&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With the execution, perhaps not; but how about the conception? You
seemed to me to have a great deal to do with it the night you took me to see
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment changed his position, raising himself, and in a moment he was seated,
Turk-fashion, beside his mate. He put his arm over his shoulder and held him,
studying his face; and then, in the kindest manner in the world, he remarked,
&ldquo;There are three or four definite chances in your favour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want comfort, you know,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, with his
eyes on the distant atmospheric mixture that represented London.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil <i>do</i> you want?&rdquo; Muniment asked, still holding
him, and with perfect good-humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, to get inside of <i>you</i> a little; to know how a chap feels
when he&rsquo;s going to part with his best friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To part with him?&rdquo; Muniment repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean, putting it at the worst.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think you would know by yourself, if you&rsquo;re going to part
with me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Hyacinth prostrated himself, tumbled over on the grass, on his face,
which he buried in his arms. He remained in this attitude, saying nothing, for
a long time; and while he lay there he thought, with a sudden, quick flood of
association, of many strange things. Most of all, he had the sense of the
brilliant, charming day; the warm stillness, touched with cries of amusement;
the sweetness of loafing there, in an interval of work, with a friend who was a
tremendously fine fellow, even if he didn&rsquo;t understand the inexpressible.
Muniment also kept silent, and Hyacinth perceived that he was unaffectedly
puzzled. He wanted now to relieve him, so that he pulled himself together again
and turned round, saying the first thing he could think of, in relation to the
general subject of their conversation, that would carry them away from the
personal question: &ldquo;I have asked you before, and you have told me, but
somehow I have never quite grasped it (so I just touch on the matter again),
exactly what good you think it will do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This idea of Hoffendahl&rsquo;s? You must remember that as yet we know
only very vaguely what it is. It is difficult, therefore, to measure closely
the importance it may have, and I don&rsquo;t think I have ever, in talking
with you, pretended to fix that importance. I don&rsquo;t suppose it will
matter immensely whether your own engagement is carried out or not; but if it
is it will have been a detail in a scheme of which the general effect will be
decidedly useful. I believe, and you pretend to believe, though I am not sure
you do, in the advent of the democracy. It will help the democracy to get
possession that the classes that keep them down shall be admonished from time
to time that they have a very definite and very determined intention of doing
so. An immense deal will depend upon that. Hoffendahl is a capital
admonisher.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth listened to this explanation with an expression of interest that was
not feigned; and after a moment he rejoined, &ldquo;When you say you believe in
the democracy, I take for granted you mean you positively wish for their coming
into power, as I have always supposed. Now what I really have never understood
is this&mdash;why you should desire to put forward a lot of people whom you
regard, almost without exception, as donkeys.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear lad,&rdquo; laughed Muniment, &ldquo;when one undertakes to
meddle in human affairs one must deal with human material. The upper classes
have the longest ears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard you say that you were working for an equality in human
conditions, to abolish the immemorial inequality. What you want, then, for all
mankind is a similar <i>nuance</i> of asininity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very clever; did you pick it up in France? The low tone of
our fellow-mortals is a result of bad conditions; it is the conditions I want
to alter. When those that have no start to speak of have a good one, it is but
fair to infer that they will go further. I want to try them, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why equality?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked. &ldquo;Somehow, that word
doesn&rsquo;t say so much to me as it used to. Inequality&mdash;inequality! I
don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s by dint of repeating it over to myself, but
<i>that</i> doesn&rsquo;t shock me as it used.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t put you up to that in France, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;
Muniment exclaimed. &ldquo;Your point of view has changed; you have risen in
the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Risen? Good God, what have I risen to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True enough; you were always a bloated little swell!&rdquo; And Muniment
gave his young friend a sociable slap on the back. There was a momentary
bitterness in its being imputed to such a one as Hyacinth, even in joke, that
he had taken sides with the fortunate ones of the earth, and he had it on his
tongue&rsquo;s end to ask his friend if he had never guessed what his proud
titles were&mdash;the bastard of a murderess, spawned in a gutter, out of which
he had been picked by a sewing-girl. But his life-long reserve on this point
was a habit not easily broken, and before such an inquiry could flash through
it Muniment had gone on: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve ceased to believe we can do
anything, it will be rather awkward, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I believe, God help me!&rdquo; Hyacinth
remarked, in a tone of an effect so lugubrious that Paul gave one of his
longest, most boyish-sounding laughs. And he added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
you to think I have ceased to care for the people. What am I but one of the
poorest and meanest of them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You, my boy? You&rsquo;re a duke in disguise, and so I thought the first
time I ever saw you. That night I took you to Hoffendahl you had a little way
with you that made me forget it; I mean that your disguise happened to be
better than usual. As regards caring for the people, there&rsquo;s surely no
obligation at all,&rdquo; Muniment continued. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I
could help it&mdash;I promise you that. It all depends on what you see. The way
<i>I</i>&rsquo;ve used my eyes in this abominable metropolis has led to my
seeing that present arrangements won&rsquo;t do. They won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he
repeated, placidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see that, too,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, with the same dolefulness
that had marked his tone a moment before&mdash;a dolefulness begotten of the
rather helpless sense that, whatever he saw, he saw (and this was always the
case) so many other things beside. He saw the immeasurable misery of the
people, and yet he saw all that had been, as it were, rescued and redeemed from
it: the treasures, the felicities, the splendours, the successes, of the world.
All this took the form, sometimes, to his imagination, of a vast, vague,
dazzling presence, an irradiation of light from objects undefined, mixed with
the atmosphere of Paris and of Venice. He presently added that a hundred things
Muniment had told him about the foul horrors of the worst districts of London,
pictures of incredible shame and suffering that he had put before him, came
back to him now, with the memory of the passion they had kindled at the time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want you to go by what I have told you; I want you to
go by what you have seen yourself. I remember there were things you told me
that weren&rsquo;t bad in their way.&rdquo; And at this Paul Muniment sprang to
his feet, as if their conversation had drawn to an end, or they must at all
events be thinking of their homeward way. Hyacinth got up, too, while his
companion stood there. Muniment was looking off toward London, with a face that
expressed all the healthy singleness of his vision. Suddenly Paul remarked, as
if it occurred to him to complete, or at any rate confirm, the declaration he
had made a short time before, &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t believe in the
millennium, but I do believe in the democracy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young man, as he spoke these words, struck his comrade as such a fine
embodiment of the spirit of the people; he stood there, in his powerful, sturdy
newness, with such an air of having learnt what he had learnt and of
good-nature that had purposes in it, that our hero felt the simple inrush of
his old, frequent pride at having a person of that promise, a nature of that
capacity, for a friend. He passed his hand into Muniment&rsquo;s arm and said,
with an imperceptible tremor in his voice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your saying
I&rsquo;m not to go by what you tell me. I would go by what you tell me,
anywhere. There&rsquo;s no awkwardness to speak of. I don&rsquo;t know that I
believe exactly what you believe, but I believe in you, and doesn&rsquo;t that
come to the same thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment evidently appreciated the cordiality and candour of this little
tribute, and the way he showed it was by a movement of his arm, to check his
companion, before they started to leave the spot, and by looking down at him
with a certain anxiety of friendliness. &ldquo;I should never have taken you to
Hoffendahl if I hadn&rsquo;t thought you would jump at the job. It was that
flaring little oration of yours, at the club, when you floored Delancey for
saying you were afraid, that put me up to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did jump at it&mdash;upon my word I did; and it was just what I was
looking for. That&rsquo;s all correct!&rdquo; said Hyacinth, cheerfully, as
they went forward. There was a strain of heroism in these words&mdash;of
heroism of which the sense was not conveyed to Muniment by a vibration in their
interlocked arms. Hyacinth did not make the reflection that he was infernally
literal; he dismissed the sentimental problem that had bothered him; he
condoned, excused, admired&mdash;he merged himself, resting happy for the time
in the consciousness that Paul was a grand fellow, that friendship was a purer
feeling than love, and that there was an immense deal of affection between
them. He did not even observe at that moment that it was preponderantly on his
own side.

<h3><a name="chap36"></a>XXXVI</h3>

<p>
A certain Sunday in November, more than three months after she had gone to live
in Madeira Crescent, was so important an occasion for the Princess Casamassima
that I must give as complete an account of it as the limits of my space will
allow. Early in the afternoon a loud peal from her door-knocker came to her
ear; it had a sound of resolution, almost of defiance, which made her look up
from her book and listen. She was sitting by the fire, alone, with a volume of
a heavy work on Labour and Capital in her hand. It was not yet four
o&rsquo;clock, but she had had candles for an hour; a dense brown fog made the
daylight impure, without suggesting an answer to the question whether the
scheme of nature had been to veil or to deepen the sabbatical dreariness. She
was not tired of Madeira Crescent&mdash;such an idea she would indignantly have
repudiated; but the prospect of a visitor was rather pleasant to her&mdash;the
possibility even of his being an ambassador, or a cabinet minister, or another
of the eminent personages with whom she had associated before embracing the
ascetic life. They had not knocked at her present door hitherto in any great
numbers, for more reasons than one; they were out of town, and she had taken
pains to diffuse the belief that she had left England. If the impression
prevailed, it was exactly the impression she had desired; she forgot this fact
whenever she felt a certain surprise, even, it may be, a certain irritation, in
perceiving that people were not taking the way to Madeira Crescent. She was
making the discovery, in which she had had many predecessors, that in London it
is only too possible to hide one&rsquo;s self. It was very much in that fashion
that Godfrey Sholto was in the habit of announcing himself, when he reappeared
after the intervals she explicitly imposed upon him; there was a kind of
artlessness, for so world-worn a personage, in the point he made of showing
that he knocked with confidence, that he had as good a right as any other. This
afternoon she was ready to accept a visit from him: she was perfectly detached
from the shallow, frivolous world in which he lived, but there was still a
freshness in her renunciation which coveted reminders and enjoyed comparisons;
he would prove to her how right she had been to do exactly what she was doing.
It did not occur to her that Hyacinth Robinson might be at her door, for it was
understood between them that, except by special appointment, he was to come to
see her only in the evening. She heard in the hail, when the servant arrived, a
voice that she failed to recognise; but in a moment the door of the room was
thrown open and the name of Mr Muniment was pronounced. It may be said at once
that she felt great pleasure in hearing it, for she had both wished to see more
of Hyacinth&rsquo;s extraordinary friend and had given him up, so little likely
had it begun to appear that he would put himself out for her. She had been glad
he wouldn&rsquo;t come, as she had told Hyacinth three months before; but now
that he had come she was still more glad.
</p>

<p>
Presently he was sitting opposite to her, on the other side of the fire, with
his big foot crossed over his big knee, his large, gloved hands fumbling with
each other, drawing and smoothing the gloves (of very red, new-looking
dog-skin) in places, as if they hurt him. So far as the size of his
extremities, and even his attitude and movement, went, he might have belonged
to her former circle. With the details of his dress remaining vague in the
lamp-light, which threw into relief mainly his powerful, important head, he
might have been one of the most considerable men she had ever known. The first
thing she said to him was that she wondered extremely what had brought him at
last to come to see her: the idea, when she proposed it, evidently had so
little attraction for him. She had only seen him once since then&mdash;the day
she met him coming into Audley Court as she was leaving it, after a visit to
his sister&mdash;and, as he probably remembered, she had not on that occasion
repeated her invitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have done any good, at the time, if you had,&rdquo;
Muniment rejoined, with his natural laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I felt that; my silence wasn&rsquo;t accidental!&rdquo; the Princess
exclaimed, joining in his merriment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have only come now&mdash;since you have asked me the
reason&mdash;because my sister hammered at me, week after week, dinning it into
me that I ought to. Oh, I&rsquo;ve been under the lash! If she had left me
alone, I wouldn&rsquo;t have come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess blushed on hearing these words, but not with shame or with pain;
rather with the happy excitement of being spoken to in a manner so fresh and
original. She had never before had a visitor who practised so racy a frankness,
or who, indeed, had so curious a story to tell. She had never before so
completely failed, and her failure greatly interested her, especially as it
seemed now to be turning a little to success. She had succeeded promptly with
every one, and the sign of it was that every one had rendered her a monotony of
homage. Even poor little Hyacinth had tried, in the beginning, to say sweet
things to her. This very different type of man appeared to have his thoughts
fixed on anything but sweetness; she felt the liveliest hope that he would move
further and further away from it. &ldquo;I remember what you asked
me&mdash;what good it would do you. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you then; and though
I now have had a long time to turn it over, I haven&rsquo;t thought of it
yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but I hope it will do me some,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;A fellow
wants a reward, when he has made a great effort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does me some,&rdquo; the Princess remarked, gaily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naturally, the awkward things I say amuse you. But I don&rsquo;t say
them for that, but just to give you an idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You give me a great many ideas. Besides, I know you already a good
deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From little Robinson, I suppose,&rdquo; said Muniment.
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated. &ldquo;More particularly from Lady Aurora.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she doesn&rsquo;t know much about me!&rdquo; the young man
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you say that, because she likes you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she likes me,&rdquo; Muniment replied, serenely.
</p>

<p>
Again the Princess hesitated. &ldquo;And I hope you like her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, she&rsquo;s a dear old girl!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess reflected that her visitor was not a gentleman, like Hyacinth; but
this made no difference in her present attitude. The expectation that he would
be a gentleman had had nothing to do with her interest in him; that, in fact,
had rested largely on the supposition that he had a rich plebeian strain.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there is any one in the world I envy so
much,&rdquo; she remarked; an observation which her visitor received in
silence. &ldquo;Better than any one I have ever met she has solved the
problem&mdash;which, if we are wise, we all try to solve, don&rsquo;t
we?&mdash;of getting out of herself. She has got out of herself more perfectly
than any one I have ever known. She has merged herself in the passion of doing
something for others. That&rsquo;s why I envy her,&rdquo; said the Princess,
with an explanatory smile, as if perhaps he didn&rsquo;t understand her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amusement, like any other,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, not like any other! It carries light into dark places; it makes a
great many wretched people considerably less wretched.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many, eh?&rdquo; asked the young man, not exactly as if he wished to
dispute, but as if it were always in him to enjoy an argument.
</p>

<p>
The Princess wondered why he should desire to argue at Lady Aurora&rsquo;s
expense. &ldquo;Well, one who is very near to you, to begin with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s kind, most kind; it&rsquo;s altogether wonderful. But
Rosy makes <i>her</i> considerably less wretched,&rdquo; Paul Muniment
rejoined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely, of course; and so she does me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I inquire what you are wretched about?&rdquo; Muniment went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About nothing at all. That&rsquo;s the worst of it. But I am much
happier now than I have ever been.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that also about nothing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, about a sort of change that has taken place in my life. I have been
able to do some little things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the poor, I suppose you mean. Do you refer to the presents you have
made to Rosy?&rdquo; the young man inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The presents?&rdquo; The Princess appeared not to remember. &ldquo;Oh,
those are trifles. It isn&rsquo;t anything one has been able to give;
it&rsquo;s some talks one has had, some convictions one has arrived at.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Convictions are a source of very innocent pleasure,&rdquo; said the
young man, smiling at his interlocutress with his bold, pleasant eyes, which
seemed to project their glance further than any she had seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Having them is nothing. It&rsquo;s the acting on them,&rdquo; the
Princess replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; that doubtless, too, is good.&rdquo; He continued to look at her
peacefully, as if he liked to consider that this might be what she had asked
him to come for. He said nothing more, and she went on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s far better, of course, when one is a man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Women do pretty well what they like. My sister and
you have managed, between you, to bring me to this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more your sister, I suspect, than I. But why, after all,
should you have disliked so much to come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, since you ask me,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment, &ldquo;I will tell
you frankly, though I don&rsquo;t mean it uncivilly, that I don&rsquo;t know
what to make of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most people don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned the Princess. &ldquo;But they
usually take the risk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, I&rsquo;m the most prudent of men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was sure of it; that is one of the reasons why I wanted to know you. I
know what some of your ideas are&mdash;Hyacinth Robinson has told me; and the
source of my interest in them is partly the fact that you consider very
carefully what you attempt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I do&mdash;I do,&rdquo; said Muniment, simply.
</p>

<p>
The tone in which he said this would have been almost ignoble, as regards a
kind of northern canniness which it expressed, had it not been corrected by the
character of his face, his youth and strength, and his military eye. The
Princess recognised both the shrewdness and the latent audacity as she
rejoined, &ldquo;To do anything with you would be very safe. It would be sure
to succeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what poor Hyacinth thinks,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment.
</p>

<p>
The Princess wondered a little that he could allude in that light tone to the
faith their young friend had placed in him, considering the consequences such a
trustfulness might yet have; but this curious mixture of qualities could only
make her visitor, as a tribune of the people, more interesting to her. She
abstained for the moment from touching on the subject of Hyacinth&rsquo;s
peculiar position, and only said, &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he told you about me?
Hasn&rsquo;t he explained me a little?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, his explanations are grand!&rdquo; Muniment exclaimed, hilariously.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine sport when he talks about you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t betray him,&rdquo; said the Princess, gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to betray. You would be the first to admire it if
you were there. Besides, I don&rsquo;t betray,&rdquo; the young man added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love him very much,&rdquo; said the Princess; and it would have been
impossible for the most impudent cynic to smile at the manner in which she made
the declaration.
</p>

<p>
Paul accepted it respectfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sweet little lad, and,
putting her ladyship aside, quite the light of our home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause after this exchange of amenities, which the Princess
terminated by inquiring, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t some one else do his work quite
as well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His work? Why, I&rsquo;m told he&rsquo;s a master-hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean his bookbinding.&rdquo; Then the Princess added,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you know it, but I am in correspondence with
Hoffendahl. I am acquainted with many of our most important men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know it. Hyacinth has told me. Do you mention it as a guarantee,
so that I may know you are genuine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly; that would be weak, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the Princess
asked. &ldquo;My genuineness must be in myself&mdash;a matter for you to
appreciate as you know me better; not in my references and vouchers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall never know you better. What business is it of mine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to help you,&rdquo; said the Princess, and as she made this
earnest appeal her face became transfigured; it wore an expression of the most
passionate yet the purest longing. &ldquo;I want to do something for the cause
you represent; for the millions that are rotting under our feet&mdash;the
millions whose whole life is passed on the brink of starvation, so that the
smallest accident pushes them over. Try me, test me; ask me to put my hand to
something, to prove that I am as deeply in earnest as those who have already
given proof. I know what I am talking about&mdash;what one must meet and face
and count with, the nature and the immensity of your organisation. I am not
playing. No, I am not playing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment watched her with his steady smile until this sudden outbreak had
spent itself. &ldquo;I was afraid you would be like this&mdash;that you would
turn on the fountains and let off the fireworks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Permit me to believe you thought nothing about it. There is no reason my
fireworks should disturb you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have always had a fear of women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see&mdash;that&rsquo;s a part of your prudence,&rdquo; said the
Princess, reflectively. &ldquo;But you are the sort of man who ought to know
how to use them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment said nothing, immediately, in answer to this; the way he appeared to
consider the Princess suggested that he was not following closely what she
said, so much as losing himself in certain matters which were beside that
question&mdash;her beauty, for instance, her grace, her fragrance, the
spectacle of a manner and quality so new to him. After a little, however, he
remarked, irrelevantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m very rude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you are, but it doesn&rsquo;t signify. What I mainly object to
is that you don&rsquo;t answer my questions. Would not some one else do
Hyacinth Robinson&rsquo;s work quite as well? Is it necessary to take a nature
so delicate, so intellectual? Oughtn&rsquo;t we to keep him for something
finer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Finer than what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Than what Hoffendahl will call upon him to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray what is that?&rdquo; the young man demanded. &ldquo;You know
nothing about it; no more do I,&rdquo; he added in a moment. &ldquo;It will
require whatever it will. Besides, if some one else might have done it, no one
else volunteered. It happened that Robinson did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and you nipped him up!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
At this expression Muniment burst out laughing. &ldquo;I have no doubt you can
easily keep him, if you want him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to do it in his place&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I should
like,&rdquo; said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I say, you don&rsquo;t even know what it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be nothing,&rdquo; she went on, with her grave eyes fixed on her
visitor. &ldquo;I dare say you think that what I wanted to see you for was to
beg you to let him off. But it wasn&rsquo;t. Of course it&rsquo;s his own
affair, and you can do nothing. But oughtn&rsquo;t it to make some difference,
when his opinions have changed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His opinions? He never had any opinions,&rdquo; Muniment replied.
&ldquo;He is not like you and me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, his feelings, his attachments. He hasn&rsquo;t the passion
for democracy he had when I first knew him. He&rsquo;s much more tepid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, he&rsquo;s quite right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess stared. &ldquo;Do you mean that <i>you</i> are giving
up&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fine stiff conservative is a thing I perfectly understand,&rdquo; said
Paul Muniment. &ldquo;If I were on the top, I&rsquo;d stick there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see, you are not narrow,&rdquo; the Princess murmured, appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I am. I don&rsquo;t call that wide. One must be
narrow to penetrate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever you are, you&rsquo;ll succeed,&rdquo; said the Princess.
&ldquo;Hyacinth won&rsquo;t, but you will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It depends upon what you call success!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed.
And in a moment, before she replied, he added, looking about the room,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a very lovely dwelling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lovely? My dear sir, it&rsquo;s hideous. That&rsquo;s what I like it
for,&rdquo; the Princess added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I like it; but perhaps I don&rsquo;t know the reason. I thought
you had given up everything&mdash;pitched your goods out of the window, for a
grand scramble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, so I have. You should have seen me before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have liked that,&rdquo; said Muniment, smiling. &ldquo;I like
to see solid wealth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re as bad as Hyacinth. I am the only consistent
one!&rdquo; the Princess sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a great deal left, for a person who has given everything
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These are not mine&mdash;these abominations&mdash;or I would give them,
too!&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s hostess rejoined, artlessly.
</p>

<p>
Muniment got up from his chair, still looking about the room. &ldquo;I would
give my nose for such a place as this. At any rate, you are not yet reduced to
poverty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a little left&mdash;to help you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ve a great deal,&rdquo; said Paul, with his
north-country accent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could get money&mdash;I could get money,&rdquo; the Princess
continued, gravely. She had also risen, and was standing before him.
</p>

<p>
These two remarkable persons faced each other, their eyes met again, and they
exchanged a long, deep glance of mutual scrutiny. Each seemed to drop a plummet
into the other&rsquo;s mind. Then a strange and, to the Princess, unexpected
expression passed over the countenance of the young man; his lips compressed
themselves, as if he were making a strong effort, his colour rose, and in a
moment he stood there blushing like a boy. He dropped his eyes and stared at
the carpet, while he observed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust women&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t trust women!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry, but, after all, I can understand it,&rdquo; said the
Princess; &ldquo;therefore I won&rsquo;t insist on the question of your
allowing me to work with you. But this appeal I will make to you: help me a
little yourself&mdash;help me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, help you?&rdquo; Muniment demanded, raising his eyes,
which had a new, conscious look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Advise me; you will know how. I am in trouble&mdash;I have gone very
far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt of that!&rdquo; said Paul, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean with some of those people abroad. I&rsquo;m not frightened, but
I&rsquo;m perplexed; I want to know what to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you are not frightened,&rdquo; Muniment rejoined, after a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am, however, in a sad entanglement. I think you can straighten it out.
I will give you the facts, but not now, for we shall be interrupted; I hear my
old lady on the stairs. For this, you must come to see me again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point the door opened, and Madame Grandoni appeared, cautiously,
creepingly, as if she didn&rsquo;t know what might be going on in the parlour.
&ldquo;Yes, I will come again,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment, in a low but distinct
tone; and he walked away, passing Madame Grandoni on the threshold, without
having exchanged the hand-shake of farewell with his hostess. In the hall he
paused an instant, feeling she was behind him; and he learned that she had not
come to exact from him this omitted observance, but to say once more, dropping
her voice, so that her companion, through the open door, might not hear&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>could</i> get money&mdash;I could!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment passed his hand through his hair, and, as if he had not heard her,
remarked, &ldquo;I have not given you, after all, half Rosy&rsquo;s
messages.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; the Princess answered, turning
back into the parlour.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni was in the middle of the room, wrapped in an old shawl, looking
vaguely around her, and the two ladies heard the house-door close. &ldquo;And
pray, who may that be? Isn&rsquo;t it a new face?&rdquo; the elder one
inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the brother of the little person I took you to see over the
river&mdash;the chattering cripple with the wonderful manners.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, she had a brother! That, then, was why you went?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was striking, the good-humour with which the Princess received this rather
coarse thrust, which could have been drawn from Madame Grandoni only by the
petulance and weariness of increasing age, and the antipathy she now felt to
Madeira Crescent and everything it produced. Christina bent a calm, charitable
smile upon her ancient companion, and replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There could have been no question of our seeing him. He was, of course,
at his work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, how do I know, my dear? And is he a successor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A successor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the little bookbinder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;you will see how absurd
that question is when I tell you he&rsquo;s his greatest friend!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap37"></a>XXXVII</h3>

<p>
Half an hour after Paul Muniment&rsquo;s departure the Princess heard another
rat-tat-tat at her door; but this was a briefer, discreeter peal, and was
accompanied by a faint tintinnabulation. The person who had produced it was
presently ushered in, without, however, causing Madame Grandoni to look round,
or rather to look up, from an arm-chair as low as a sitz-bath, and of very much
the shape of such a receptacle, in which, near the fire, she had been immersed.
She left this care to the Princess, who rose on hearing the name of the visitor
pronounced, inadequately, by her maid. &lsquo;Mr Fetch&rsquo; Assunta called
it; but the Princess recognised without difficulty the little fat,
&lsquo;reduced&rsquo; fiddler of whom Hyacinth had talked to her, who, as
Pinnie&rsquo;s most intimate friend, had been so mixed up with his existence,
and whom she herself had always had a curiosity to see. Hyacinth had not told
her he was coming, and the unexpectedness of the apparition added to its
interest. Much as she liked seeing queer types and exploring out-of-the-way
social corners, she never engaged in a fresh encounter, nor formed a new
relation of this kind, without a fit of nervousness, a fear that she might be
awkward and fail to hit the right tone. She perceived in a moment, however,
that Mr Vetch would take her as she was and require no special adjustments; he
was a gentleman and a man of experience, and she would only have to leave the
tone to him. He stood there with his large, polished hat in his two hands, a
hat of the fashion of ten years before, with a rusty sheen and an undulating
brim&mdash;stood there without a salutation or a speech, but with a little
fixed, acute, tentative smile, which seemed half to inquire and half to
explain. What he explained was that he was clever enough to be trusted, and
that if he had come to see her that way, abruptly, without an invitation, he
had a reason which she would be sure to think good enough when she should hear
it. There was even a certain jauntiness in this confidence&mdash;an insinuation
that he knew how to present himself to a lady; and though it quickly appeared
that he really did, that was the only thing about him that was
inferior&mdash;it suggested a long experience of actresses at rehearsal, with
whom he had formed habits of advice and compliment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know who you are&mdash;I know who you are,&rdquo; said the Princess,
though she could easily see that he knew she did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder whether you also know why I have come to see you,&rdquo; Mr
Vetch replied, presenting the top of his hat to her as if it were a
looking-glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I am very glad; you might even have
come before.&rdquo; Then the Princess added, with her characteristic honesty,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know of the great interest I have taken in your
nephew?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In my nephew? Yes, my young friend Robinson. It is in regard to him that
I have ventured to intrude upon you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess had been on the point of pushing a chair toward him, but she
stopped in the act, staring, with a smile. &ldquo;Ah, I hope you haven&rsquo;t
come to ask me to give him up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary&mdash;on the contrary!&rdquo; the old man rejoined,
lifting his hand expressively, and with his head on one side, as if he were
holding his violin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, on the contrary?&rdquo; the Princess demanded, after he
had seated himself and she had sunk into her former place. As if that might
sound contradictious, she went on: &ldquo;Surely he hasn&rsquo;t any fear that
I shall cease to be a good friend to him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he fears; I don&rsquo;t know what he
hopes,&rdquo; said Mr Vetch, looking at her now with a face in which she could
see there was something more tonic than old-fashioned politeness. &ldquo;It
will be difficult to tell you, but at least I must try. Properly speaking, I
suppose, it&rsquo;s no business of mine, as I am not a blood-relation to the
boy; but I have known him since he was an urchin, and I can&rsquo;t help saying
that I thank you for your great kindness to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the same, I don&rsquo;t think you like it,&rdquo; the Princess
remarked. &ldquo;To me it oughtn&rsquo;t to be difficult to say
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has told me very little about you; he doesn&rsquo;t know I have taken
this step,&rdquo; the fiddler said, turning his eyes about the room, and
letting them rest on Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you call it a &lsquo;step&rsquo;?&rdquo; the Princess asked.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what people say when they have to do something
disagreeable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I call very seldom on ladies. It&rsquo;s long time since I have been in
the house of a person like the Princess Casamassima. I remember the last
time,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;It was to get some money from a lady at
whose party I had been playing&mdash;for a dance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must bring your fiddle, sometime, and play to us. Of course I
don&rsquo;t mean for money,&rdquo; the Princess rejoined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will do it with pleasure, or anything else that will gratify you. But
my ability is very small. I only know vulgar music&mdash;things that are played
at theatres.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that; there must be things you play for yourself,
in your room, alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment the old man made no reply; then he said, &ldquo;Now that I see
you, that I hear you, it helps me to understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you do see me!&rdquo; cried the Princess, kindly,
laughing; while the fiddler went on to ask whether there were any danger of
Hyacinth&rsquo;s coming in while he was there. The Princess replied that he
only came, unless by prearrangement, in the evening, and Mr Vetch made a
request that she would not let their young friend know that he himself had been
with her. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter; he will guess it, he will know it by
instinct, as soon as he comes in. He is terribly subtle,&rdquo; said the
Princess; and she added that she had never been able to hide anything from him.
Perhaps it served her right, for attempting to make a mystery of things that
were not worth it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How well you know him!&rdquo; Mr Vetch murmured, with his eyes wandering
again to Madame Grandoni, who paid no attention to him as she sat staring at
the fire. He delayed, visibly, to say what he had come for, and his hesitation
could only be connected with the presence of the old lady. He said to himself
that the Princess might have divined this from his manner; he had an idea that
he could trust himself to convey such an intimation with clearness and yet with
delicacy. But the most she appeared to apprehend was that he desired to be
presented to her companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must know the most delightful of women. She also takes a particular
interest in Mr Robinson: of a different kind from mine&mdash;much more
sentimental!&rdquo; And then she explained to the old lady, who seemed absorbed
in other ideas, that Mr Vetch was a distinguished musician, a person whom she,
who had known so many in her day, and was so fond of that kind of thing, would
like to talk with. The Princess spoke of &lsquo;that kind of thing&rsquo; quite
as if she herself had given it up, though Madame Grandoni heard her by the hour
together improvising on the piano revolutionary battle-songs and pæans.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you are laughing at me,&rdquo; Mr Vetch said to the Princess,
while Madame Grandoni twisted herself slowly round in her chair and considered
him. She looked at him leisurely, up and down, and then she observed, with a
sigh&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strange people&mdash;strange people!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is indeed a strange world, madam,&rdquo; the fiddler replied; and he
then inquired of the Princess whether he might have a little conversation with
her in private.
</p>

<p>
She looked about her, embarrassed and smiling. &ldquo;My dear sir, I have only
this one room to receive in. We live in a very small way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, your excellency <i>is</i> laughing at me. Your ideas are very
large, too. However, I would gladly come at any other time that might suit
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You impute to me higher spirits than I possess. Why should I be so
gay?&rdquo; the Princess asked. &ldquo;I should be delighted to see you again.
I am extremely curious as to what you may have to say to me. I would even meet
you anywhere&mdash;in Kensington Gardens or the British Museum.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler looked at her a moment before replying; then, with his white old
face flushing a little, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Poor dear little Hyacinth!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni made an effort to rise from her chair, but she had sunk so low
that at first it was not successful. Mr Vetch gave her his hand, to help her,
and she slowly erected herself, keeping hold of him for a moment after she
stood there. &ldquo;What did she tell me? That you are a great musician?
Isn&rsquo;t that enough for any man? You ought to be content, my dear
gentleman. It has sufficed for people whom I don&rsquo;t believe you
surpass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t surpass any one,&rdquo; said poor Mr Vetch. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what you take me for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are not a conspirator, then? You are not an assassin? It surprises
me, but so much the better. In this house one can never know. It is not a good
house, and if you are a respectable person it is a pity you should come here.
Yes, she is very gay, and I am very sad. I don&rsquo;t know how it will end.
After me, I hope. The world is not good, certainly; but God alone can make it
better.&rdquo; And as the fiddler expressed the hope that he was not the cause
of her leaving the room, she went on, &ldquo;<i>Doch, doch</i>, you are the
cause; but why not you as well as another? I am always leaving it for some one
or for some thing, and I would sooner do so for an honest man, if you
<i>are</i> one&mdash;but, as I say, who can tell?&mdash;than for a destroyer. I
wander about. I have no rest. I have, however, a very nice room, the best in
the house. Me, at least, she does not treat ill. It looks to-day like the end
of all things. If you would turn your climate the other side up, the rest would
do well enough. Good-night to you, whoever you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady shuffled away, in spite of Mr Vetch&rsquo;s renewed apologies, and
the Princess stood before the fire, watching her companions, while he opened
the door. &ldquo;She goes away, she comes back; it doesn&rsquo;t matter. She
thinks it&rsquo;s a bad house, but she knows it would be worse without her. I
remember now,&rdquo; the Princess added. &ldquo;Mr Robinson told me that you
had been a great democrat in old days, but that now you had ceased to care for
the people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The people&mdash;the people? That is a vague term. Whom do you
mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated. &ldquo;Those you used to care for, to plead for; those
who are underneath every one, every thing, and have the whole social mass
crushing them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you think I&rsquo;m a renegade. The way certain classes arrogate
to themselves the title of the people has never pleased me. Why are some human
beings the people, and the people only, and others not? I am of the people
myself, I have worked all my days like a knife-grinder, and I have really never
changed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must not let me make you angry,&rdquo; said the Princess, laughing
and sitting down again. &ldquo;I am sometimes very provoking, but you must stop
me off. You wouldn&rsquo;t think it, perhaps, but no one takes a snub better
than I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch dropped his eyes a minute; he appeared to wish to show that he
regarded such a speech as that as one of the Princess&rsquo;s characteristic
humours, and knew that he should be wanting in respect to her if he took it
seriously or made a personal application of it. &ldquo;What I want is
this,&rdquo; he began, after a moment: &ldquo;that you will&mdash;that you
will&mdash;&rdquo; But he stopped before he had got further. She was watching
him, listening to him, and she waited while he paused. It was a long pause, and
she said nothing. &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; the old man broke out at last,
&ldquo;I would give my own life many times for that boy&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always told him you must have been fond of him!&rdquo; she cried, with
bright exultation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fond of him? Pray, who can doubt it? I made him, I invented him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He knows it, moreover,&rdquo; said the Princess, smiling. &ldquo;It is
an exquisite organisation.&rdquo; And as the old man gazed at her, not knowing,
apparently, what to make of her tone, she continued: &ldquo;It is a very
interesting opportunity for me to learn certain things. Speak to me of his
early years. How was he as a child? When I like people I want to know
everything about them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have supposed there was much left for you to learn
about our young friend. You have taken possession of his life,&rdquo; the
fiddler added, gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but as I understand you, you don&rsquo;t complain of it? Sometimes
one does so much more than one has intended. One must use one&rsquo;s influence
for good,&rdquo; said the Princess, with the noble, gentle air of accessibility
to reason that sometimes lighted up her face. And then she went on,
irrelevantly: &ldquo;I know the terrible story of his mother. He told it me
himself, when he was staying with me; and in the course of my life I think I
have never been more affected.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was my fault, that he ever learned it. I suppose he also told you
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I think he understood your idea. If you had the question to
determine again, would you judge differently?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it would do him good,&rdquo; said the old man, simply and
rather wearily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I dare say it has,&rdquo; the Princess rejoined, with the manner
of wishing to encourage him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what was in my head. I wanted him to quarrel with
society. Now I want him to be reconciled to it,&rdquo; Mr Vetch remarked,
earnestly. He appeared to wish the Princess to understand that he made a great
point of this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but he is!&rdquo; she immediately returned. &ldquo;We often talk
about that; he is not like me, who see all kinds of abominations. He&rsquo;s a
tremendous aristocrat. What more would you have?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those are not the opinions that he expresses to me,&rdquo; said Mr
Vetch, shaking his head sadly. &ldquo;I am greatly distressed, and I
don&rsquo;t understand. I have not come here with the presumptuous wish to
cross-examine you, but I should like very much to know if I <i>am</i> wrong in
believing that he has gone about with you in the bad quarters&mdash;in St
Giles&rsquo;s and Whitechapel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have certainly inquired and explored together,&rdquo; the Princess
admitted, &ldquo;and in the depths of this huge, luxurious, wanton, wasteful
city we have seen sights of unspeakable misery and horror. But we have been not
only in the slums; we have been to a music-hall and a penny-reading.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler received this information at first in silence, so that his hostess
went on to mention some of the phases of life they had observed; describing
with great vividness, but at the same time with a kind of argumentative
moderation, several scenes which did little honour to &lsquo;our boasted
civilisation&rsquo;. &ldquo;What wonder is it, then, that he should tell me
that things cannot go on any longer as they are?&rdquo; he asked, when she had
finished. &ldquo;He said only the other day that he should regard himself as
one of the most contemptible of human beings if he should do nothing to alter
them, to better them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What wonder, indeed? But if he said that, he was in one of his bad days.
He changes constantly, and his impressions change. The misery of the people is
by no means always weighing on his heart. You tell me what he has told you;
well, he has told me that the people may perish over and over, rather than the
conquests of civilisation shall be sacrificed to them. He declares, at such
moments, that they will be sacrificed&mdash;sacrificed utterly&mdash;if the
ignorant masses get the upper hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t be afraid! That will never happen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We can at least try!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Try what you like, madam, but, for God&rsquo;s sake, get the boy out of
his mess!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess had suddenly grown excited, in speaking of the cause she believed
in, and she gave, for the moment, no heed to this appeal, which broke from Mr
Vetch&rsquo;s lips with a sudden passion of anxiety. Her beautiful head raised
itself higher, and the deep expression that was always in her eyes became an
extraordinary radiance. &ldquo;Do you know what I say to Mr Robinson when he
makes such remarks as that to me? I ask him what he means by civilisation. Let
civilisation come a little, first, and then we will talk about it. For the
present, face to face with those horrors, I scorn it, I deny it!&rdquo; And the
Princess laughed ineffable things, like some splendid syren of the Revolution.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The world is very sad and very hideous, and I am happy to say that I
soon shall have done with it. But before I go I want to save Hyacinth. If
he&rsquo;s a little aristocrat, as you say, there is so much the less fitness
in his being ground in your mill. If he doesn&rsquo;t even believe in what he
pretends to do, that&rsquo;s a pretty situation! What is he in for, madam? What
devilish folly has he undertaken?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a strange mixture of contradictory impulses,&rdquo; said the
Princess, musingly. Then, as if calling herself back to the old man&rsquo;s
question, she continued: &ldquo;How can I enter into his affairs with you? How
can I tell you his secrets? In the first place, I don&rsquo;t know them, and if
I did&mdash;fancy me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler gave a long, low sigh, almost a moan, of discouragement and
perplexity. He had told the Princess that now he saw her he understood how
Hyacinth should have become her slave, but he would not have been able to tell
her that he understood her own motives and mysteries, that he embraced the
immense anomaly of her behaviour. It came over him that she was incongruous and
perverse, a more complicated form of the feminine character than any he had
hitherto dealt with, and he felt helpless and baffled, foredoomed to failure.
He had come prepared to flatter her without scruple, thinking that would be the
clever, the efficacious, method of dealing with her; but he now had a sense
that this primitive device had, though it was strange, no application to such a
nature, while his embarrassment was increased rather than diminished by the
fact that the lady at least made the effort to be accommodating. He had put
down his hat on the floor beside him, and his two hands were clasped on the
knob of an umbrella which had long since renounced pretensions to compactness;
he collapsed a little, and his chin rested on his folded hands. &ldquo;Why do
you take such a line? Why do you believe such things?&rdquo; he asked; and he
was conscious that his tone was weak and his inquiry beside the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear sir, how do you know what I believe? However, I have my reasons,
which it would take too long to tell you, and which, after all, would not
particularly interest you. One must see life as one can; it comes, no doubt, to
each of us in different ways. You think me affected, of course, and my
behaviour a fearful <i>pose;</i> but I am only trying to be natural. Are you
not yourself a little inconsequent?&rdquo; the Princess went on, with the
bright mildness which had the effect of making Mr Vetch feel that he should not
extract any pledge of assistance from her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want our
young friend to pry into the wretchedness of London, because it excites his
sense of justice. It is a strange thing to wish, for a person of whom one is
fond and whom one esteems, that his sense of justice shall not be
excited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a fig for his sense of justice&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
care a fig for the wretchedness of London; and if I were young, and beautiful,
and clever, and brilliant, and of a noble position, like you, I should care
still less. In that case I should have very little to say to a poor
mechanic&mdash;a youngster who earns his living with a glue-pot and scraps of
old leather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misrepresent him; don&rsquo;t make him out what you know
he&rsquo;s not!&rdquo; the Princess retorted, with her baffling smile.
&ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s one of the most civilised people possible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler sat breathing unhappily. &ldquo;I only want to keep him&mdash;to
get him free.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you very
well. If you like him because he&rsquo;s one of the lower orders, how can you
like him because he&rsquo;s a swell?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess turned her eyes on the fire a moment, as if this little problem
might be worth considering, and presently she answered, &ldquo;Dear Mr Vetch, I
am very sure you don&rsquo;t mean to be impertinent, but some things you say
have that effect. Nothing is more annoying than when one&rsquo;s sincerity is
doubted. I am not bound to explain myself to you. I ask of my friends to trust
me, and of the others to leave me alone. Moreover, anything not very nice you
may have said to me, out of awkwardness, is nothing to the insults I am
perfectly prepared to see showered upon me before long. I shall do things which
will produce a fine crop of them&mdash;oh, I shall do things, my dear sir! But
I am determined not to mind them. Come, therefore, pull yourself together. We
both take such an interest in young Robinson that I can&rsquo;t see why in the
world we should quarrel about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; the old man pleaded, &ldquo;I have indeed not the
least intention of failing in respect or courtesy, and you must excuse me if I
don&rsquo;t look after my manners. How can I when I am so worried, so haunted?
God knows I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel. As I tell you, I only want to get
Hyacinth free.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Free from what?&rdquo; the Princess asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From some abominable brotherhood or international league that he belongs
to, the thought of which keeps me awake at night. He&rsquo;s just the sort of
youngster to be made a cat&rsquo;s-paw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your fears seem very vague.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hoped you would give me chapter and verse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On what do your suspicions rest? What grounds have you?&rdquo; the
Princess inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, a great many; none of them very definite, but all contributing
something&mdash;his appearance, his manner, the way he strikes me. Dear madam,
one feels those things, one guesses. Do you know that poor, infatuated
phrase-monger, Eustache Poupin, who works at the same place as Hyacinth?
He&rsquo;s a very old friend of mine, and he&rsquo;s an honest man, considering
everything. But he is always conspiring, and corresponding, and pulling strings
that make a tinkle which he takes for the death-knell of society. He has
nothing in life to complain of, and he drives a roaring trade. But he wants
folks to be equal, heaven help him; and when he has made them so I suppose
he&rsquo;s going to start a society for making the stars in the sky all of the
same size. He isn&rsquo;t serious, though he thinks that he&rsquo;s the only
human being who never trifles; and his machinations, which I believe are for
the most part very innocent, are a matter of habit and tradition with him, like
his theory that Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, was a Frenchman,
and his hot foot-bath on Saturday nights. He has <i>not</i> confessed to me
that Hyacinth has taken some secret engagement to do something for the cause
which may have nasty consequences, but the way he turns off the idea makes me
almost as uncomfortable as if he had. He and his wife are very sweet on
Hyacinth, but they can&rsquo;t make up their minds to interfere; perhaps for
them, indeed, as for me, there is no way in which interference can be
effective. Only <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t put him up to those devil&rsquo;s
tricks&mdash;or, rather, I did originally! The finer the work, I suppose, the
higher the privilege of doing it; yet the Poupins heave socialistic sighs over
the boy, and their peace of mind evidently isn&rsquo;t all that it ought to be,
if they have given him a noble opportunity. I have appealed to them, in good
round terms, and they have assured me that every hair of his head is as
precious to them as if he were their own child. That doesn&rsquo;t comfort me
much, however, for the simple reason that I believe the old woman (whose
grandmother, in Paris, in the Revolution, must certainly have carried bloody
heads on a pike) would be quite capable of chopping up her own child, if it
would do any harm to proprietors. Besides, they say, what influence have they
on Hyacinth any more? He is a deplorable little backslider; he worships false
gods. In short, they will give me no information, and I dare say they
themselves are tied up by some unholy vow. They may be afraid of a vengeance if
they tell tales. It&rsquo;s all sad rubbish, but rubbish may be a strong
motive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess listened attentively, following her visitor with patience.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me of the French; I have never liked them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awkward, if you&rsquo;re a socialist. You are likely to
meet them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you call me a socialist? I hate labels and tickets,&rdquo; she
declared. Then she added, &ldquo;What is it you suppose on Mr Robinson&rsquo;s
part?&mdash;for you must suppose something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that he may have drawn some accursed lot, to do some idiotic
thing&mdash;something in which even he himself doesn&rsquo;t believe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea of what sort of thing you mean. But, if he
doesn&rsquo;t believe in it he can easily let it alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s a customer who will back out of an
engagement?&rdquo; the fiddler asked.
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated a moment. &ldquo;One can never judge of people, in that
way, until they are tested.&rdquo; The next thing, she inquired,
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you even taken the trouble to question him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would be the use? He would tell me nothing. It would be like a man
giving notice when he is going to fight a duel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess sat for some moments in thought; she looked up at Mr Vetch with a
pitying, indulgent smile. &ldquo;I am sure you are worrying about a mere
shadow; but that never prevents, does it? I still don&rsquo;t see exactly how I
can help you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you want him to commit some atrocity, some infamy?&rdquo; the old man
murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear sir, I don&rsquo;t want him to do anything in all the wide
world. I have not had the smallest connection with any arrangement of any kind,
that he may have entered into. Do me the honour to trust me,&rdquo; the
Princess went on, with a certain dryness of tone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what I have done to deprive myself of your confidence. Trust the young man a
little, too. He is a gentleman, and he will behave like a gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler rose from his chair, smoothing his hat, silently, with the cuff of
his coat. He stood there, whimsical and piteous, as if the sense that he had
still something to urge mingled with that of his having received his dismissal,
and both of them were tinged with the oddity of another idea.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I am afraid of!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Then he
added, continuing to look at her, &ldquo;But he <i>must</i> be very fond of
life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess took no notice of the insinuation contained in these words, and
indeed it was of a sufficiently impalpable character. &ldquo;Leave him to
me&mdash;leave him to me. I am sorry for your anxiety, but it was very good of
you to come to see me. That has been interesting, because you have been one of
our friend&rsquo;s influences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unfortunately, yes! If it had not been for me, he would not have known
Poupin, and if he hadn&rsquo;t known Poupin he wouldn&rsquo;t have known his
chemical friend&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name? Muniment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And has that done him harm, do you think?&rdquo; the Princess asked. She
had got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely: that fellow has been the main source of his infection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I lose patience with you,&rdquo; said the Princess, turning away.
</p>

<p>
And indeed her visitor&rsquo;s persistence was irritating. He went on,
lingering, with his head thrust forward and his short arms out at his sides,
terminating in his hat and umbrella, which he held grotesquely, as if they were
intended for emphasis or illustration: &ldquo;I have supposed for a long time
that it was either Muniment or you that had got him into his scrape. It was you
I suspected most&mdash;much the most; but if it isn&rsquo;t you, it must be
he.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had better go to him, then!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I will go to him. I scarcely know him&mdash;I have seen him
but once&mdash;but I will speak my mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess rang for her maid to usher the fiddler out, but at the moment he
laid his hand on the door of the room she checked him with a quick gesture.
&ldquo;Now that I think of it, don&rsquo;t go to Mr Muniment. It will be better
to leave him quiet. Leave him to me,&rdquo; she added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not, why not?&rdquo; he pleaded. And as she could not tell him on
the instant why not, he asked, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t know; he has nothing to do with it.&rdquo; She
suddenly found herself desiring to protect Paul Muniment from the imputation
that was in Mr Vetch&rsquo;s mind&mdash;the imputation of an ugly
responsibility; and though she was not a person who took the trouble to tell
fibs, this repudiation, on his behalf, issued from her lips before she could
check it. It was a result of the same desire, though it was also an
inconsequence, that she added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
spoil everything!&rdquo; She went to him, suddenly eager, and herself opened
the door for him. &ldquo;Leave him to me&mdash;leave him to me,&rdquo; she
continued, persuasively, while the fiddler, gazing at her, dazzled and
submissive, allowed himself to be wafted away. A thought that excited her had
come to her with a bound, and after she had heard the house-door close behind
Mr Vetch she walked up and down the room half an hour, restlessly, under the
possession of it.

<h3><a name="chap38"></a>XXXVIII</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth found, this winter, considerable occupation for his odd hours, his
evenings and holidays and scraps of leisure, in putting in hand the books which
he had promised himself, at Medley, to inclose in covers worthy of the high
station and splendour of the lady of his life (these brilliant attributes had
not then been shuffled out of sight), and of the confidence and generosity she
showed him. He had determined she should receive from him something of value,
and took pleasure in thinking that after he was gone they would be passed from
hand to hand as specimens of rare work, while connoisseurs bent their heads
over them, smiling and murmuring, handling them delicately. His invention
stirred itself, and he had a hundred admirable ideas, many of which he sat up
late at night to execute. He used all his skill, and by this time his skill was
of a very high order. Old Crookenden recognised it by raising the rates at
which he was paid; and though it was not among the traditions of the proprietor
of the establishment in Soho, who to the end wore the apron with his workmen,
to scatter sweet speeches, Hyacinth learned accidentally that several books
that he had given him to do had been carried off and placed on a shelf of
treasures at the villa, where they were exhibited to the members of the
Crookenden circle who came to tea on Sundays. Hyacinth himself, indeed, was
included in this company on a great occasion&mdash;invited to a musical party
where he made the acquaintance of half a dozen Miss Crookendens, an
acquaintance which consisted in his standing in a corner, behind several
broad-backed old ladies, and watching the rotation, at the piano and the harp,
of three or four of his master&rsquo;s thick-fingered daughters. &ldquo;You
know it&rsquo;s a tremendously musical house,&rdquo; said one of the old ladies
to another (she called it &lsquo;&rsquo;ouse&rsquo;); but the principal
impression made upon him by the performance of the Miss Crookendens was that it
was wonderfully different from the Princess&rsquo;s playing.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he was the only young man from the shop who had been invited, not
counting the foreman, who was sixty years old and wore a wig which constituted
in itself a kind of social position, besides being accompanied by a little
frightened, furtive wife, who closed her eyes, as if in the presence of a
blinding splendour, when Mrs Crookenden spoke to her. The Poupins were not
there&mdash;which, however, was not a surprise to Hyacinth, who knew that (even
if they had been asked, which they were not) they had objections of principle
to putting their feet <i>chez les bourgeois</i>. They were not asked because,
in spite of the place Eustache had made for himself in the prosperity of the
business, it had come to be known that his wife was somehow not his wife
(though she was certainly no one&rsquo;s else); and the evidence of this
irregularity was conceived to reside, vaguely, in the fact that she had never
been seen save in a camisole. There had doubtless been an apprehension that if
she had come to the villa she would not have come with the proper number of
hooks and eyes, though Hyacinth, on two or three occasions, notably the night
he took the pair to Mr Vetch&rsquo;s theatre, had been witness of the
proportions to which she could reduce her figure when she wished to give the
impression of a lawful tie.
</p>

<p>
It was not clear to him how the distinction conferred upon him became known in
Soho, where, however, it excited no sharpness of jealousy&mdash;Grugan, Roker,
and Hotchkin being hardly more likely to envy a person condemned to spend a
genteel evening than they were to envy a monkey performing antics on a
barrel-organ: both forms of effort indicated an urbanity painfully acquired.
But Roker took his young comrade&rsquo;s breath half away with his elbow and
remarked that he supposed he saw the old man had spotted him for one of the
darlings at home; inquiring, furthermore, what would become in that case of the
little thing he took to France, the one to whom he had stood champagne and
lobster. This was the first allusion Hyacinth had heard made to the idea that
he might some day marry his master&rsquo;s daughter, like the virtuous
apprentice of tradition; but the suggestion, somehow, was not inspiring, even
when he had thought of an incident or two which gave colour to it. None of the
Miss Crookendens spoke to him&mdash;they all had large faces and short legs and
a comical resemblance to that elderly male with wide nostrils, their father,
and, unlike the Miss Marchants, at Medley, they knew who he was&mdash;but their
mother, who had on her head the plumage of a cockatoo, mingled with a structure
of glass beads, looked at him with an almost awful fixedness and asked him
three distinct times if he would have a glass of negus.
</p>

<p>
He had much difficulty in getting his books from the Princess; for when he
reminded her of the promise she had given him at Medley to make over to him as
many volumes as he should require, she answered that everything was changed
since then, that she was completely <i>dépouillée</i>, that she had now no
pretension to have a library, and that, in fine, he had much better leave the
matter alone. He was welcome to any books that were in the house, but, as he
could see for himself, these were cheap editions, on which it would be foolish
to expend such work as his. He asked Madame Grandoni to help him&mdash;to tell
him, at least, whether there were not some good volumes among the things the
Princess had sent to be warehoused; it being known to him, through casual
admissions of her own, that she had allowed her maid to save certain articles
from the wreck and pack them away at the Pantechnicon. This had all been
Assunta&rsquo;s work, the woman had begged so hard for a few
reservations&mdash;a loaf of bread for their old days; but the Princess herself
had washed her hands of the business. &ldquo;<i>Chè, chè</i>, there are boxes,
I am sure, in that place, with a little of everything,&rdquo; said the old
lady, in answer to his inquiry; and Hyacinth conferred with Assunta, who took a
sympathetic, talkative, Italian interest in his undertaking and promised to
fish out for him whatever worthy volumes should remain. She came to his
lodging, one evening, in a cab, with an armful of pretty books, and when he
asked her where they had come from waved her forefinger in front of her nose,
in a manner both mysterious and expressive. He brought each volume to the
Princess, as it was finished; but her manner of receiving it was to shake her
head over it with a kind, sad smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, I am sure,
but I have lost my sense for such things. Besides, you must always remember
what you once told me, that a woman, even the most cultivated, is incapable of
feeling the difference between a bad binding and a good. I remember your once
saying that fine ladies had brought shoemaker&rsquo;s bindings to your shop,
and wished them imitated. Certainly those are not the differences I most feel.
My dear fellow, such things have ceased to speak to me; they are doubtless
charming, but they leave me cold. What will you have? One can&rsquo;t serve God
and mammon.&rdquo; Her thoughts were fixed on far other matters than the
delight of dainty covers, and she evidently considered that in caring so much
for them Hyacinth resembled the mad emperor who fiddled in the flames of Rome.
European society, to her mind, was in flames, and no frivolous occupation could
give the measure of the emotion with which she watched them. It produced
occasionally demonstrations of hilarity, of joy and hope, but these always took
some form connected with the life of the people. It was the people she had gone
to see, when she accompanied Hyacinth to a music-hall in the Edgware Road; and
all her excursions and pastimes, this winter, were prompted by her interest in
the classes on whose behalf the revolution was to be wrought.
</p>

<p>
To ask himself whether she were in earnest was now an old story to him, and,
indeed, the conviction he might arrive at on this head had ceased to have any
practical relevancy. It was just as she was, superficial or profound, that she
held him, and she was, at any rate, sufficiently animated by a purpose for her
doings to have consequences, actual and possible. Some of these might be
serious, even if she herself were not, and there were times when Hyacinth was
much visited by the apprehension of them. On the Sundays that she had gone with
him into the darkest places, the most fetid holes, in London, she had always
taken money with her, in considerable quantities, and always left it behind.
She said, very naturally, that one couldn&rsquo;t go and stare at people, for
an impression, without paying them, and she gave alms right and left,
indiscriminately, without inquiry or judgment, as simply as the abbess of some
beggar-haunted convent, or a lady-bountiful of the superstitious, unscientific
ages who should have hoped to be assisted to heaven by her doles. Hyacinth
never said to her, though he sometimes thought it, that since she was so full
of the modern spirit her charity should be administered according to the modern
lights, the principles of economical science; partly because she was not a
woman to be directed and regulated&mdash;she could take other people&rsquo;s
ideas, but she could never take their way. Besides, what did it matter? To
himself, what did it matter to-day whether he were drawn into right methods or
into wrong ones, his time being too short for regret or for cheer? The Princess
was an embodied passion&mdash;she was not a system; and her behaviour, after
all, was more addressed to relieving herself than to relieving others. And then
misery was sown so thick in her path that wherever her money was dropped it
fell into some trembling palm. He wondered that she should still have so much
cash to dispose of, until she explained to him that she came by it through
putting her personal expenditure on a rigid footing. What she gave away was her
savings, the margin she had succeeded in creating; and now that she had tasted
of the satisfaction of making little hoards for such a purpose she regarded her
other years, with their idleness and waste, their merely personal motives, as a
long, stupid sleep of the conscience. To do something for others was not only
so much more human, but so much more amusing!
</p>

<p>
She made strange acquaintances, under Hyacinth&rsquo;s conduct; she listened to
extraordinary stories, and formed theories about them, and about the persons
who narrated them to her, which were often still more extraordinary. She took
romantic fancies to vagabonds of either sex, attempted to establish social
relations with them, and was the cause of infinite agitation to the gentleman
who lived near her in the Crescent, who was always smoking at the window, and
who reminded Hyacinth of Mr Micawber. She received visits that were a scandal
to the Crescent, and Hyacinth neglected his affairs, whatever they were, to see
what tatterdemalion would next turn up at her door. This intercourse, it is
true, took a more fruitful form as her intimacy with Lady Aurora deepened; her
ladyship practised discriminations which she brought the Princess to recognise,
and before the winter was over Hyacinth&rsquo;s services in the slums were
found unnecessary. He gave way with relief, with delight, to Lady Aurora, for
he had not in the least understood his behaviour for the previous four months,
nor taken himself seriously as a <i>cicerone</i>. He had plunged into a sea of
barbarism without having any civilising energy to put forth. He was conscious
that the people were miserable&mdash;more conscious, it often seemed to him,
than they themselves were; so frequently was he struck with their brutal
insensibility, a grossness impervious to the taste of better things or to any
desire for them. He knew it so well that the repetition of contact could add no
vividness to the conviction; it rather smothered and befogged his impression,
peopled it with contradictions and difficulties, a violence of reaction, a
sense of the inevitable and insurmountable. In these hours the poverty and
ignorance of the multitude seemed so vast and preponderant, and so much the law
of life, that those who had managed to escape from the black gulf were only the
happy few, people of resource as well as children of luck; they inspired in
some degree the interest and sympathy that one should feel for survivors and
victors, those who have come safely out of a shipwreck or a battle. What was
most in Hyacinth&rsquo;s mind was the idea, of which every pulsation of the
general life of his time was a syllable, that the flood of democracy was rising
over the world; that it would sweep all the traditions of the past before it;
that, whatever it might fail to bring, it would at least carry in its bosom a
magnificent energy; and that it might be trusted to look after its own. When
democracy should have its way everywhere, it would be its fault (whose else?)
if want and suffering and crime should continue to be ingredients of the human
lot. With his mixed, divided nature, his conflicting sympathies, his eternal
habit of swinging from one view to another, Hyacinth regarded this prospect, in
different moods, with different kinds of emotion. In spite of the example
Eustache Poupin gave him of the reconcilement of disparities, he was afraid the
democracy wouldn&rsquo;t care for perfect bindings or for the finest sort of
conversation. The Princess gave up these things in proportion as she advanced
in the direction she had so audaciously chosen; and if the Princess could give
them up it would take very transcendent natures to stick to them. At the same
time there was joy, exultation, in the thought of surrendering one&rsquo;s self
to the wave of revolt, of floating in the tremendous tide, of feeling
one&rsquo;s self lifted and tossed, carried higher on the sun-touched crests of
billows than one could ever be by a dry, lonely effort of one&rsquo;s own. That
vision could deepen to a kind of ecstasy; make it indifferent whether
one&rsquo;s ultimate fate, in such a heaving sea, were not almost certainly to
be submerged in bottomless depths or dashed to pieces on resisting cliffs.
Hyacinth felt that, whether his personal sympathy should rest finally with the
victors or the vanquished, the victorious force was colossal and would require
no testimony from the irresolute.
</p>

<p>
The reader will doubtless smile at his mental debates and oscillations, and not
understand why a little bastard bookbinder should attach importance to his
conclusions. They were not important for either cause, but they were important
for himself, if only because they would rescue him from the torment of his
present life, the perpetual laceration of the rebound. There was no peace for
him between the two currents that flowed in his nature, the blood of his
passionate, plebeian mother and that of his long-descended, supercivilised
sire. They continued to toss him from one side to the other; they arrayed him
in intolerable defiances and revenges against himself. He had a high ambition:
he wanted neither more nor less than to get hold of the truth and wear it in
his heart. He believed, with the candour of youth, that it is brilliant and
clear-cut, like a royal diamond; but in whatever direction he turned in the
effort to find it, he seemed to know that behind him, bent on him in reproach,
was a tragic, wounded face. The thought of his mother had filled him,
originally, with the vague, clumsy fermentation of his first impulses toward
social criticism; but since the problem had become more complex by the fact
that many things in the world as it was constituted grew intensely dear to him,
he had tried more and more to construct some conceivable and human countenance
for his father&mdash;some expression of honour, of tenderness and recognition,
of unmerited suffering, or at least of adequate expiation. To desert one of
these presences for the other&mdash;that idea had a kind of shame in it, as an
act of treachery would have had; for he could almost hear the voice of his
father ask him if it were the conduct of a gentleman to take up the opinions
and emulate the crudities of fanatics and cads. He had got over thinking that
it would not have become his father to talk of what was proper to gentlemen,
and making the mental reflection that from him, at least, the biggest cad in
London could not have deserved less consideration. He had worked himself round
to allowances, to interpretations, to such hypotheses as the evidence in the
<i>Times</i>, read in the British Museum on that never-to-be-forgotten
afternoon, did not exclude; though they had been frequent enough, and too
frequent, his hours of hot resentment against the man who had attached to him
the stigma he was to carry for ever, he threw himself, in other conditions, and
with a certain success, into the effort to find condonations, excuses, for him.
It was comparatively easy for him to accept himself as the son of a terribly
light Frenchwoman; there seemed a deeper obloquy even than that in his having
for his other parent a nobleman altogether wanting in nobleness. He was too
poor to afford it. Sometimes, in his imagination, he sacrificed one to the
other, throwing over Lord Frederick much the oftener; sometimes, when the
theory failed that his father would have done great things for him if he had
lived, or the assumption broke down that he had been Florentine Vivier&rsquo;s
only lover, he cursed and disowned them alike; sometimes he arrived at
conceptions which presented them side by side, looking at him with eyes
infinitely sad but quite unashamed&mdash;eyes which seemed to tell him that
they had been hideously unfortunate but had not been base. Of course his worst
moments now, as they had always been the worst, were those in which his grounds
for thinking that Lord Frederick had really been his father perversely fell
away from him. It must be added that they always passed, for the mixture that
he felt himself so tormentingly, so insolubly, to be could be accounted for in
no other manner.

<p>
I mention these dim broodings not because they belong in an especial degree to
the history of our young man during the winter of the Princess&rsquo;s
residence in Madeira Crescent, but because they were a constant element in his
moral life and need to be remembered in any view of him at a given time. There
were nights of November and December, as he trod the greasy pavements that lay
between Westminster and Paddington, groping his way through the baffled
lamp-light and tasting the smoke-seasoned fog, when there was more happiness in
his heart than he had ever known. The influence of his permeating London had
closed over him again; Paris and Milan and Venice had shimmered away into
reminiscence and picture; and as the great city which was most his own lay
round him under her pall, like an immeasurable breathing monster, he felt, with
a vague excitement, as he had felt before, only now with more knowledge, that
it was the richest expression of the life of man. His horizon had been
immensely widened, but it was filled, again, by the expanse that sent dim
night-gleams and strange blurred reflections and emanations into a sky without
stars. He suspended, as it were, his small sensibility in the midst of it, and
it quivered there with joy and hope and ambition, as well as with the effort of
renunciation. The Princess&rsquo;s quiet fireside glowed with deeper
assurances, with associations of intimacy, through the dusk and the immensity;
the thought of it was with him always, and his relations with the mistress of
it were more organised than they had been in his first vision of her. Whether
or no it was better for the cause she cherished that she should have been
reduced to her present simplicity, it was better, at least, for Hyacinth. It
made her more near and him more free; and if there had been a danger of her
nature seeming really to take the tone of the vulgar things about her, he would
only have had to remember her as she was at Medley to restore the perspective.
In truth, her beauty always appeared to have the setting that best became it;
her fairness made the element in which she lived and, among the meanest
accessories, constituted a kind of splendour. Nature had multiplied the
difficulties in the way of her successfully representing herself as having
properties in common with the horrible populace of London. Hyacinth used to
smile at this pretension in his night-walks to Paddington, or homeward; the
populace of London were scattered upon his path, and he asked himself by what
wizardry they could ever be raised to high participations. There were nights
when every one he met appeared to reek with gin and filth, and he found himself
elbowed by figures as foul as lepers. Some of the women and girls, in
particular, were appalling&mdash;saturated with alcohol and vice, brutal,
bedraggled, obscene. &lsquo;What remedy but another deluge, what alchemy but
annihilation?&rsquo; he asked himself, as he went his way; and he wondered what
fate there could be, in the great scheme of things, for a planet overgrown with
such vermin, what redemption but to be hurled against a ball of consuming fire.
If it was the fault of the rich, as Paul Muniment held, the selfish, congested
rich, who allowed such abominations to flourish, that made no difference, and
only shifted the shame; for the terrestrial globe, a visible failure, produced
the cause as well as the effect.
</p>

<p>
It did not occur to Hyacinth that the Princess had withdrawn her confidence
from him because, for the work of investigating still further the condition of
the poor, she placed herself in the hands of Lady Aurora. He could have no
jealousy of the noble spinster; he had too much respect for her philanthropy,
the thoroughness of her knowledge, and her capacity to answer any question it
could come into the Princess&rsquo;s extemporising head to ask, and too acute a
consciousness of his own desultory and superficial attitude toward the great
question. It was enough for him that the little parlour in Madeira Crescent was
a spot round which his thoughts could revolve, and toward which his steps could
direct themselves, with an unalloyed sense of security and privilege. The
picture of it hung before him half the time, in colours to which the feeling of
the place gave a rarity that doubtless did not literally characterise the
scene. His relations with the Princess had long since ceased to appear to him
to belong to the world of fable; they were as natural as anything else
(everything in life was queer enough); he had by this time assimilated them, as
it were, and they were an indispensable part of the happiness of each.
&lsquo;Of each&rsquo;&mdash;Hyacinth risked that, for there was no particular
vanity now involved in his perceiving that the most remarkable woman in Europe
was, simply, very fond of him. The quiet, familiar, fraternal welcome he found
on the nasty winter nights was proof enough of that. They sat together like
very old friends, whom long pauses, during which they simply looked at each
other with kind, acquainted eyes, could not make uncomfortable. Not that the
element of silence was the principal part of their conversation, for it
interposed only when they had talked a great deal. Hyacinth, on the opposite
side of the fire, felt at times almost as if he were married to his hostess, so
many things were taken for granted between them. For intercourse of that sort,
intimate, easy, humorous, circumscribed by drawn curtains and shaded
lamp-light, and interfused with domestic embarrassments and confidences, all
turning to the jocular, the Princess was incomparable. It was her theory of her
present existence that she was picnicking; but all the accidents of the
business were happy accidents. There was a household quietude in her steps and
gestures, in the way she sat, in the way she listened, in the way she played
with the cat, or looked after the fire, or folded Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s
ubiquitous shawl; above all, in the inveteracy with which she spent her
evenings at home, never dining out nor going to parties, ignorant of the
dissipations of the town. There was something in the isolation of the room,
when the kettle was on the hob and he had given his wet umbrella to the maid
and the Princess made him sit in a certain place near the fire, the better to
dry his shoes&mdash;there was something that evoked the idea of the <i>vie de
province</i>, as he had read about it in French works. The French term came to
him because it represented more the especial note of the Princess&rsquo;s
company, the cultivation, the facility, of talk. She expressed herself often in
the French tongue itself; she could borrow that convenience, for certain shades
of meaning, though she had told Hyacinth that she didn&rsquo;t like the people
to whom it was native. Certainly, the quality of her conversation was not
provincial; it was singularly free and unrestricted; there was nothing one
mightn&rsquo;t say to her or that she was not liable to say herself. She had
cast off prejudices and gave no heed to conventional danger-posts. Hyacinth
admired the movement&mdash;his eyes seemed to see it&mdash;with which, in any
direction, intellectually, she could fling open her windows. There was an
extraordinary charm in this mixture of liberty and humility&mdash;in seeing a
creature capable, socially, of immeasurable flights sit dove-like, with folded
wings.
</p>

<p>
The young man met Lady Aurora several times in Madeira Crescent (her days, like
his own, were filled with work, and she came in the evening), and he knew that
her friendship with the Princess had arrived at a rich maturity. The two ladies
were a source of almost rapturous interest to each other, and each rejoiced
that the other was not a bit different. The Princess prophesied freely that her
visitor would give her up&mdash;all nice people did, very soon; but to Hyacinth
the end of her ladyship&rsquo;s almost breathless enthusiasm was not yet in
view. She was bewildered, but she was fascinated; and she thought the Princess
not only the most distinguished, the most startling, the most edifying and the
most original person in the world, but the most amusing and the most delightful
to have tea with. As for the Princess, her sentiment about Lady Aurora was the
same that Hyacinth&rsquo;s had been: she thought her a saint, the first she had
ever seen, and the purest specimen conceivable; as good in her way as St
Francis of Assisi, as tender and naïve and transparent, of a spirit of charity
as sublime. She held that when one met a human flower as fresh as that in the
dusty ways of the world one should pluck it and wear it; and she was always
inhaling Lady Aurora&rsquo;s fragrance, always kissing her and holding her
hand. The spinster was frightened at her generosity, at the way her imagination
embroidered; she wanted to convince her (as the Princess did on her own side)
that such exaggerations destroyed their unfortunate subject. The Princess
delighted in her clothes, in the way she put them on and wore them, in the
economies she practised in order to have money for charity and the ingenuity
with which these slender resources were made to go far, in the very manner in
which she spoke, a kind of startled simplicity. She wished to emulate her in
all these particulars; to learn how to economise still more cunningly, to get
her bonnets at the same shop, to care as little for the fit of her gloves, to
ask, in the same tone, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a bore Susan Crotty&rsquo;s
husband has got a ticket-of-leave?&rdquo; She said Lady Aurora made her feel
like a French milliner, and that if there was anything in the world she loathed
it was a French milliner. Each of these persons was powerfully affected by the
other&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies, and each wanted the other to remain as she was
while she herself should be transformed into the image of her friend.
</p>

<p>
One evening, going to Madeira Crescent a little later than usual, Hyacinth met
Lady Aurora on the doorstep, leaving the house. She had a different air from
any he had seen in her before; appeared flushed and even a little agitated, as
if she had been learning a piece of bad news. She said, &ldquo;Oh, how do you
do?&rdquo; with her customary quick, vague laugh; but she went her way, without
stopping to talk.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth, on going in, mentioned to the Princess that he had encountered her,
and this lady replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you didn&rsquo;t come a little
sooner. You would have assisted at a scene.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At a scene?&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated, not understanding what violence
could have taken place between mutual adorers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She made me a scene of tears, of earnest remonstrance&mdash;perfectly
well meant, I needn&rsquo;t tell you. She thinks I am going too far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I imagine you tell her things that you don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you, my dear fellow!&rdquo; the Princess murmured. She spoke
absent-mindedly, as if she were thinking of what had passed with Lady Aurora,
and as if the futility of telling things to Hyacinth had become a commonplace.
</p>

<p>
There was no annoyance for him in this, his pretension to keep pace with her
&lsquo;views&rsquo; being quite extinct. The tone they now, for the most part,
took with each other was one of mutual derision, of shrugging commiseration for
insanity on the one hand and benightedness on the other. In discussing with her
he exaggerated deliberately, went to fantastic lengths in the way of reaction;
and it was their habit and their entertainment to hurl all manner of
denunciation at each other&rsquo;s head. They had given up serious discussion
altogether, and when they were not engaged in bandying, in the spirit of
burlesque, the amenities I have mentioned, they talked of matters as to which
it could not occur to them to differ. There were evenings when the Princess did
nothing but relate her life and all that she had seen of humanity, from her
earliest years, in a variety of countries. If the evil side of it appeared
mainly to have been presented to her view, this did not diminish the interest
and vividness of her reminiscences, nor her power, the greatest Hyacinth had
ever encountered, of light pictorial, dramatic evocation. She was irreverent
and invidious, but she made him hang on her lips; and when she regaled him with
anecdotes of foreign courts (he delighted to know how sovereigns lived and
conversed), there was often, for hours together, nothing to indicate that she
would have liked to get into a conspiracy and he would have liked to get out of
one. Nevertheless, his mind was by no means exempt from wonder as to what she
was really doing in the dark and in what queer consequences she might find
herself landed. When he questioned her she wished to know by what title, with
his sentiments, he pretended to inquire. He did so but little, not being
himself altogether convinced of the validity of his warrant; but on one
occasion, when she challenged him, he replied, smiling and hesitating,
&ldquo;Well, I must say, it seems to me that, from what I have told you, it
ought to strike you that I have a title.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean your famous engagement, your vow? Oh, that will never come to
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t it come to anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too absurd, it&rsquo;s too vague. It&rsquo;s like some silly
humbug in a novel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Vous me rendez la vie!</i>&rdquo; said Hyacinth, theatrically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to do it,&rdquo; the Princess went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you mean I won&rsquo;t do it. I have offered, at least;
isn&rsquo;t that a title?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, you won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said the Princess; and they
looked at each other a couple of minutes in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will, I think, at the pace you are going,&rdquo; the young man
resumed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you know about the pace? You are not worthy to know!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did know, however; that is, he knew that she was in communication with
foreign socialists and had, or believed she had, irons on the fire&mdash;that
she held in her hand some of the strings that are pulled in great movements.
She received letters that made Madame Grandoni watch her askance, of which,
though she knew nothing of their contents and had only her general suspicions
and her scent for disaster, now become constant, the old woman had spoken more
than once to Hyacinth. Madame Grandoni had begun to have sombre visions of the
interference of the police: she was haunted with the idea of a search for
compromising papers; of being dragged, herself, as an accomplice in direful
plots, into a court of justice&mdash;possibly into a prison. &ldquo;If she
would only burn&mdash;if she would only burn! But she keeps&mdash;I know she
keeps!&rdquo; she groaned to Hyacinth, in her helpless gloom. Hyacinth could
only guess what it might be that she kept; asking himself whether she were
seriously entangled, were being exploited by revolutionary Bohemians, predatory
adventurers who counted on her getting frightened at a given moment and
offering hush-money to be allowed to slip out (out of a complicity which they,
of course, would never have taken seriously); or were merely coquetting with
paper schemes, giving herself cheap sensations, discussing preliminaries which,
for her, could have no second stage. It would have been easy for Hyacinth to
smile at the Princess&rsquo;s impression that she was &lsquo;in it&rsquo;, and
to conclude that even the cleverest women do not know when they are
superficial, had not the vibration remained which had been imparted to his
nerves two years before, of which he had spoken to his hostess at
Medley&mdash;the sense, vividly kindled and never quenched, that the forces
secretly arrayed against the present social order were pervasive and universal,
in the air one breathed, in the ground one trod, in the hand of an acquaintance
that one might touch, or the eye of a stranger that might rest a moment upon
one&rsquo;s own. They were above, below, within, without, in every contact and
combination of life; and it was no disproof of them to say it was too odd that
they should lurk in a particular improbable form. To lurk in improbable forms
was precisely their strength, and they would doubtless exhibit much stranger
incidents than this of the Princess&rsquo;s being a genuine participant even
when she flattered herself that she was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do go too far,&rdquo; Hyacinth said to her, the evening Lady Aurora
had passed him at the door.
</p>

<p>
To which she answered, &ldquo;Of course I do&mdash;that&rsquo;s exactly what I
mean. How else does one know one has gone far enough? That poor, dear woman!
She&rsquo;s an angel, but she isn&rsquo;t in the least in it,&rdquo; she added,
in a moment. She would give him no further satisfaction on the subject; when he
pressed her she inquired whether he had brought the copy of Browning that he
had promised the last time. If he had, he was to sit down and read it to her.
In such a case as this Hyacinth had no disposition to insist; he was glad
enough not to talk about the everlasting nightmare. He took <i>Men and
Women</i> from his pocket, and read aloud for half an hour; but on his making
some remark on one of the poems, at the end of this time he perceived the
Princess had been paying no attention. When he charged her with this levity she
only replied, looking at him musingly, &ldquo;How <i>can</i> one, after all, go
too far? That&rsquo;s a word of cowards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean her ladyship is a coward?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, in not having the courage of her opinions, of her conclusions. The
way the English can go half-way to a thing, and then stick in the
middle!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your fault, certainly!&rdquo; said Hyacinth. &ldquo;But
it seems to me that Lady Aurora, for herself, goes pretty far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are all afraid of some things, and brave about others,&rdquo; the
Princess went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The thing Lady Aurora is most afraid of is the Princess
Casamassima,&rdquo; Hyacinth remarked.
</p>

<p>
His companion looked at him, but she did not take this up. &ldquo;There is one
particular in which she would be very brave. She would marry her
friend&mdash;your friend&mdash;Mr Muniment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marry him, do you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What else, pray?&rdquo; the Princess asked. &ldquo;She adores the ground
he walks on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what would Belgrave Square, and Inglefield, and all the rest of it,
say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do they say already, and how much does it make her swerve? She
would do it in a moment; and it would be fine to see it, it would be
magnificent,&rdquo; said the Princess, kindling, as she was apt to kindle, at
the idea of any great freedom of action.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be a case of what you call sticking in the
middle,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a matter of logic; it would be a matter of
passion. When it&rsquo;s a question of that, the English, to do them justice,
don&rsquo;t stick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This speculation of the Princess&rsquo;s was by no means new to Hyacinth, and
he had not thought it heroic, after all, that their high-strung friend should
feel herself capable of sacrificing her family, her name, and the few habits of
gentility that survived in her life, of making herself a scandal, a fable, and
a nine days&rsquo; wonder, for Muniment&rsquo;s sake; the young chemist&rsquo;s
assistant being, to his mind, as we know, exactly the type of man who produced
convulsions, made ruptures and renunciations easy. But it was less clear to him
what ideas Muniment might have on the subject of a union with a young woman who
should have come out of her class for him. He would marry some day, evidently,
because he would do all the natural, human, productive things; but for the
present he had business on hand which would be likely to pass first.
Besides&mdash;Hyacinth had seen him give evidence of this&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t
think people could really come out of their class; he held that the stamp of
one&rsquo;s origin is ineffaceable and that the best thing one can do is to
wear it and fight for it. Hyacinth could easily imagine how it would put him
out to be mixed up, closely, with a person who, like Lady Aurora, was fighting
on the wrong side. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t marry him unless he asks her, I
suppose&mdash;and perhaps he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he reflected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, perhaps he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Princess, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday afternoons Paul Muniment was able to leave his work at four
o&rsquo;clock, and on one of these occasions, some time after his visit to
Madeira Crescent, he came into Rosy&rsquo;s room at about five, carefully
dressed and brushed, and ruddy with the freshness of an abundant washing. He
stood at the foot of her sofa, with a conscious smile, knowing how she chaffed
him when his necktie was new; and after a moment, during which she ceased
singing to herself as she twisted the strands of her long black hair together
and let her eyes travel over his whole person, inspecting every detail, she
said to him, &ldquo;My dear Mr Muniment, you are going to see the
Princess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, have you anything to say against it?&rdquo; Mr Muniment asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a word; you know I like princesses. But you have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my girl, I&rsquo;ll not speak it to you,&rdquo; the young man
rejoined. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something to be said against everything, if
you&rsquo;ll give yourself trouble enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should be very sorry if ever anything was said against you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a sneak who is only and always praised,&rdquo; Muniment
remarked. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t hope to be finely abused, where would be
the encouragement?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but not with reason,&rdquo; said Rosy, who always brightened to an
argument.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The better the reason, the greater the incentive to expose one&rsquo;s
self. However, you won&rsquo;t hear it, if people do heave bricks at me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear it? Pray, don&rsquo;t I hear everything? I should
like any one to keep anything from <i>me!</i>&rdquo; And Miss Muniment gave a
toss of her recumbent head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal I keep from you, my dear,&rdquo; said Paul,
rather dryly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean there are things I don&rsquo;t want, I don&rsquo;t take any
trouble, to know. Indeed and indeed there are: things that I wouldn&rsquo;t
know for the world&mdash;that no amount of persuasion would induce me, not if
you was to go down on your knees. But if I did&mdash;if I did, I promise you
that just as I lie here I should have them all in my pocket. Now there are
others,&rdquo; the young woman went on&mdash;&ldquo;there are others that you
will just be so good as to tell me. When the Princess asked you to come and see
her you refused, and you wanted to know what good it would do. I hoped you
would go, then; I should have liked you to go, because I wanted to know how she
lived, and whether she had things handsome, or only in the poor way she said.
But I didn&rsquo;t push you, because I couldn&rsquo;t have told you what good
it <i>would</i> do you: that was only the good it would have done me. At
present I have heard everything from Lady Aurora, and I know that it&rsquo;s
all quite decent and tidy (though not really like a princess a bit), and that
she knows how to turn everything about and put it best end foremost, just as I
do, like, though <i>I</i> oughtn&rsquo;t to say it, no doubt. Well, you have
been, and more than once, and I have had nothing to do with it; of which I am
very glad now, for reasons that you perfectly know&mdash;you&rsquo;re too
honest a man to pretend you don&rsquo;t. Therefore, when I see you going again,
I just inquire of you, as you inquired of her, what good <i>does</i> it do
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like it&mdash;I like it, my dear,&rdquo; said Paul, with his fresh,
unembarrassed smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say you do. So should I, in your place. But it&rsquo;s the first
time I have heard you express the idea that we ought to do everything we
like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not, when it doesn&rsquo;t hurt any one else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr Muniment, Mr Muniment!&rdquo; Rosy exclaimed, with exaggerated
solemnity, holding up a straight, attenuated forefinger at him. Then she added,
&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t do you good, that beautiful, brilliant
woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give her time, my dear&mdash;give her time,&rdquo; said Paul, looking at
his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you are impatient, but you <i>must</i> hear me. I have no
doubt she&rsquo;ll wait for you; you won&rsquo;t lose your turn. Please, what
would you do if any one was to break down altogether?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My bonny lassie,&rdquo; the young man rejoined, &ldquo;if <i>you</i>
only keep going, I don&rsquo;t care who fails.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I shall keep going, if it&rsquo;s only to look after my friends and
get justice for them,&rdquo; said Miss Muniment&mdash;&ldquo;the delicate,
sensitive creatures who require support and protection. Have you really
forgotten that we have such a one as that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young man walked to the window, with his hands in his pockets, and looked
out at the fading light. &ldquo;Why does she go herself, then, if she
doesn&rsquo;t like her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose Muniment hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not a
man!&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;I think a woman on her back is cleverer than
a man on his two legs. And you such a wonderful one, too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are all too clever for me, my dear. If she goes&mdash;and twenty
times a week, too&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t I go, once in ever so long?
Especially as I like her, and Lady Aurora doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lady Aurora doesn&rsquo;t? Do you think she&rsquo;d be guilty of
hypocrisy? Lady Aurora delights in her; she won&rsquo;t let me say that she
herself is fit to dust the Princess&rsquo;s shoes. I needn&rsquo;t tell
<i>you</i> how she goes down before them she likes. And I don&rsquo;t believe
you care a button; you have got something in your head, some wicked game or
other, that you think she can hatch for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Paul Muniment turned round and looked at his sister a moment, smiling
still and whistling just audibly. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I care?
Ain&rsquo;t I soft, ain&rsquo;t I susceptible?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never thought I should hear you ask that, after what I have seen these
four years. For four years she has come, and it&rsquo;s all for you, as well it
might be, and you never showing any more sense of what she&rsquo;d be willing
to do for you than if you had been that woollen cat on the hearth-rug!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you like me to do? Would you like me to hang round her neck
and hold her hand, the same as you do?&rdquo; Muniment asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it would do me good, I can tell you. It&rsquo;s better than what I
see&mdash;the poor lady getting spotted and dim, like a mirror that wants
rubbing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know a good deal, Rosy, but you don&rsquo;t know everything,&rdquo;
Muniment remarked in a moment, with a face that gave no sign of seeing a reason
in what she said. &ldquo;Your mind is too poetical. There&rsquo;s nothing that
I should care for that her ladyship would be willing to do for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She would marry you at a day&rsquo;s notice&mdash;she&rsquo;d do
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care for that. Besides, if I was to ask her she would
never come into the place again. And I shouldn&rsquo;t care for that, for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind me; I&rsquo;ll take the risk!&rdquo; cried Rosy, gaily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be gained, if I can have her, for you, without any
risk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have her for me, or for any one, when she&rsquo;s dead
of a broken heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dead of a broken tea-cup!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;And, pray,
what should we live on, when you had got us set up?&mdash;the three of us,
without counting the kids.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He evidently was arguing from pure good-nature, and not in the least from
curiosity; but his sister replied as eagerly as if he would be floored by her
answer: &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she got two hundred a year of her own? Don&rsquo;t
I know every penny of her affairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Paul Muniment gave no sign of any mental criticism he may have made on
Rosy&rsquo;s conception of the delicate course, or of a superior policy;
perhaps, indeed, for it is perfectly possible, her inquiry did not strike him
as having a mixture of motives. He only rejoined, with a little pleasant,
patient sigh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the dear old girl&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His sister, in spite of her eagerness, waited twenty seconds; then she flashed
at him, &ldquo;Pray, do you like the Princess&rsquo;s better?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I did, there would be more of it,&rdquo; he answered, quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can she marry you? Hasn&rsquo;t she got a husband?&rdquo; Rosy
cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, how you give me away!&rdquo; laughed her brother. &ldquo;Daughters
of earls, wives of princes&mdash;I have only to pick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak of the Princess, so long as there&rsquo;s a prince.
But if you haven&rsquo;t seen that Lady Aurora is a beautiful, wonderful
exception, and quite unlike any one else in all the wide world&mdash;well, all
I can say is that <i>I</i> have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was your opinion,&rdquo; Paul objected, &ldquo;that the
swells should remain swells, and the high ones keep their place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, pray, would she lose hers if she were to marry you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her place at Inglefield, certainly,&rdquo; said Paul, as patiently as if
his sister could never tire him with any insistence or any minuteness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she lost that already? Does she ever go there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely you appear to think so, from the way you always question her
about it,&rdquo; replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, they think her so mad already that they can&rsquo;t think her any
madder,&rdquo; his sister continued. &ldquo;They have given her up, and if she
were to marry you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she were to marry me, they wouldn&rsquo;t touch her with a ten-foot
pole,&rdquo; Paul broke in.
</p>

<p>
Rosy flinched a moment; then she said, serenely, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care
for that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to, to be consistent, though, possibly, she shouldn&rsquo;t,
admitting that she wouldn&rsquo;t. You have more imagination than
logic&mdash;which of course, for a woman, is quite right. That&rsquo;s what
makes you say that her ladyship is in affliction because I go to a place that
she herself goes to without the least compulsion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She goes to keep you off,&rdquo; said Rosy, with decision.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To keep me off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To interpose, with the Princess; to be nice to her and conciliate her,
so that she may not take you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did she tell you any such rigmarole as that?&rdquo; Paul inquired, this
time staring a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I need to be told things, to know them? I am not a fine, strong,
superior male; therefore I can discover them for myself,&rdquo; answered Rosy,
with a dauntless little laugh and a light in her eyes which might indeed have
made it appear that she was capable of wizardry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You make her out at once too passionate and too calculating,&rdquo; the
young man rejoined. &ldquo;She has no personal feelings, she wants nothing for
herself. She only wants one thing in the world&mdash;to make the poor a little
less poor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely; and she regards you, a helpless, blundering bachelor, as one
of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She knows I am not helpless so long as you are about the place, and that
my blunders don&rsquo;t matter so long as you correct them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She wants to assist me to assist you, then!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed,
with the levity with which her earnestness was always interfused; it was a
spirit that seemed, at moments, in argument, to mock at her own contention.
&ldquo;Besides, isn&rsquo;t that the very thing you want to bring about?&rdquo;
she went on. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you are plotting and working and
waiting for? She wants to throw herself into it&mdash;to work with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear girl, she doesn&rsquo;t understand a pennyworth of what I think.
She couldn&rsquo;t if she would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And no more do I, I suppose you mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more do you; but with you it&rsquo;s different. If you would, you
could. However, it matters little who understands and who doesn&rsquo;t, for
there&rsquo;s mighty little of it. I&rsquo;m not doing much, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rosy lay there looking up at him. &ldquo;It must be pretty thick, when you talk
that way. However, I don&rsquo;t care what happens, for I know I shall be
looked after.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing will happen&mdash;nothing will happen,&rdquo; Paul remarked,
simply.
</p>

<p>
The girl&rsquo;s rejoinder to this was to say in a moment, &ldquo;You have a
different tone since you have taken up the Princess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She spoke with a certain severity, but he broke out, as if he had not heard
her, &ldquo;I like your idea of the female aristocracy quarrelling over a dirty
brute like me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how dirty you are, but I know you smell of
soap,&rdquo; said Rosy, with serenity. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t quarrel;
that&rsquo;s not the way they do it. Yes, you are taking a different tone, for
some purpose that I can&rsquo;t discover just yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that? When did I ever take a tone?&rdquo; her
brother asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why then do you speak as if you were not remarkable, immensely
remarkable&mdash;more remarkable than anything any one, male or female, good or
bad, of the aristocracy or of the vulgar sort, can ever do for you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What on earth have I ever done to show it?&rdquo; Paul demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know your secrets, and that&rsquo;s one of them. But
we&rsquo;re out of the common beyond any one, you and I, and, between
ourselves, with the door fastened, we might as well admit it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I admit it for you, with all my heart,&rdquo; said the young man,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, if I admit it for you, that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s
required.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The brother and sister considered each other a while in silence, as if each
were tasting, agreeably, the distinction the other conferred; then Muniment
said, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m such an awfully superior chap, why shouldn&rsquo;t I
behave in keeping?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you do, you do!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the same, you don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much what you do; it&rsquo;s what <i>she</i>
does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, what she does?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She makes Lady Aurora suffer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t go into that,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;A man feels
like a muff, talking about the women that &lsquo;suffer&rsquo; for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if they do it, I think <i>you</i> might bear it!&rdquo; Rosy
exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what a man is. When it comes to being sorry, oh,
that&rsquo;s too ridiculous!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are plenty of things in the world I&rsquo;m sorry for,&rdquo; Paul
rejoined, smiling. &ldquo;One of them is that you should keep me gossiping here
when I want to go out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care if I worry her a little. Does she do it on
purpose?&rdquo; Rosy continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ladies must settle all that together,&rdquo; Muniment answered,
rubbing his hat with the cuff of his coat. It was a new one, the bravest he had
ever possessed, and in a moment he put it on his head, as if to reinforce his
reminder to his sister that it was time she should release him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you do look genteel,&rdquo; she remarked, complacently, gazing up
at him. &ldquo;No wonder she has lost her head! I mean the Princess,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;You never went to any such expense for her ladyship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, the Princess is worth it&mdash;she&rsquo;s worth it,&rdquo;
said the young man, speaking seriously now, and reflectively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will she help you very much?&rdquo; Rosy demanded, with a strange,
sudden transition to eagerness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s rather what I look
for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She threw herself forward on her sofa, with a movement that was rare with her,
and shaking her clasped hands she exclaimed, &ldquo;Then go off, go off
quickly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He came round and kissed her, as if he were not more struck than usual with her
freakish inconsequence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad to have a little person at
home who wants a fellow to succeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know they will look after me,&rdquo; she said, sinking back upon
her pillow with an air of agreeable security.
</p>

<p>
He was aware that whenever she said &lsquo;they&rsquo;, without further
elucidation, she meant the populace surging up in his rear, and he rejoined,
always hilarious, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll leave it much to
&lsquo;them&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not much you&rsquo;ll leave to them, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave a louder laugh at this, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the deepest of
the lot, Miss Muniment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes kindled at his praise, and as she rested them on her brother&rsquo;s
she murmured, &ldquo;Well, I pity the poor Princess, too, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;m not conceited, but I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Paul
returned, passing in front of the little mirror on the mantel-shelf.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll succeed, and so shall I&mdash;but <i>she</i>
won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rosy went on.
</p>

<p>
Muniment stopped a moment, with his hand on the latch of the door, and said,
gravely, almost sententiously, &ldquo;She is not only beautiful, as beautiful
as a picture, but she is uncommon sharp, and she has taking ways, beyond
anything that ever was known.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know her ways,&rdquo; his sister replied. Then, as he left the room,
she called after him, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care for anything, so long as
you become prime minister of England!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Three quarters of an hour after this Muniment knocked at the door in Madeira
Crescent, and was immediately ushered into the parlour, where the Princess, in
her bonnet and mantle, sat alone. She made no movement as he came in; she only
looked up at him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are braver than I gave you credit for,&rdquo; she said, in her rich
voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall learn to be brave, if I associate a while longer with you. But I
shall never cease to be shy,&rdquo; Muniment added, standing there and looking
tall in the middle of the small room. He cast his eyes about him for a place to
sit down, but the Princess gave him no help to choose; she only watched him, in
silence, from her own place, with her hands quietly folded in her lap. At last,
when, without remonstrance from her, he had selected the most uncomfortable
chair in the room, she replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only another name for desperate courage. I put on my
bonnet, on the chance, but I didn&rsquo;t expect you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, here I am&mdash;that&rsquo;s the great thing,&rdquo; Muniment
said, good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, no doubt it&rsquo;s a very great thing. But it will be a still
greater thing when you are there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid you hope too much,&rdquo; the young man observed.
&ldquo;Where is it? I don&rsquo;t think you told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess drew a small folded letter from her pocket, and, without saying
anything, held it out to him. He got up to take it from her, opened it, and, as
he read it, remained standing in front of her. Then he went straight to the
fire and thrust the paper into it. At this movement she rose quickly, as if to
save the document, but the expression of his face, as he turned round to her,
made her stop. The smile that came into her own was a little forced.
&ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I take it the house is
known. If we go, I suppose we may admit that we go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment&rsquo;s face showed that he had been annoyed, but he answered, quietly
enough, &ldquo;No writing&mdash;no writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are terribly careful,&rdquo; said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Careful of you&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sank down upon her sofa again, asking her companion to ring for tea; they
would do much better to have some before going out. When the order had been
given, she remarked, &ldquo;I see I shall have much less keen emotion than when
I acted by myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that what you go in for&mdash;keen emotion?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, Mr Muniment. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God forbid! I hope to have as little of it as possible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course one doesn&rsquo;t want any vague rodomontade; one wants to do
something. But it would be hard if one couldn&rsquo;t have a little pleasure by
the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My pleasure is in quietness,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So is mine. But it depends on how you understand it. Quietness, I mean,
in the midst of a tumult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have rare ideas about tumults. They are not good in
themselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess considered this a moment; then she remarked, &ldquo;I wonder if
you are too prudent. I shouldn&rsquo;t like that. If it is made an accusation
against you that you have been&mdash;where we are going&mdash;shall you deny
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With that prospect it would be simpler not to go at all, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; Muniment inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which prospect do you mean? That of being found out, or that of having
to lie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that if you lie you are not found out,&rdquo; Muniment
replied, humorously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take me seriously,&rdquo; said the Princess. She spoke
without irritation, without resentment, with a kind of resigned sadness. But
there was a certain fineness of reproach in the tone in which she added,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you want to go at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why else should I have come, especially if I don&rsquo;t take you
seriously?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That has never been a reason for a man&rsquo;s not going to see a
woman,&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s usually a reason in favour
of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment turned his smiling eyes over the room, looking from one article of
furniture to another: this was a way he had when he was engaged in a
discussion, and it suggested not so much that he was reflecting on what his
interlocutor said as that his thoughts were pursuing a cheerfully independent
course. Presently he observed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I quite
understand what you mean by that question of taking a woman seriously.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you are very perfect,&rdquo; murmured the Princess.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you consider that the changes you look for will be also for
our benefit?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they will alter your position.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t hope for that, I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo;
said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have no doubt you&rsquo;ll do a great deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young man&rsquo;s companion was silent for some minutes, during which he
also was content to say nothing. &ldquo;I wonder you can find it in your
conscience to work with me,&rdquo; she observed at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in my conscience I find it,&rdquo; said Muniment,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
The maid-servant brought in the tea, and while the Princess was making a place
for it on a little table beside her she exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t
care, for I think I have you in my power!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have every one in your power,&rdquo; returned Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every one is no one,&rdquo; the Princess replied, rather dryly; and a
moment later she said to him, &ldquo;That extraordinary little sister of
yours&mdash;surely you take <i>her</i> seriously?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wonderful fond of her, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. But I
don&rsquo;t think her position will ever be altered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you alluding to her position in bed? If you consider that she will
never recover her health,&rdquo; the Princess said, &ldquo;I am very sorry to
hear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, her health will do. I mean that she will continue to be, like all
the most amiable women, just a kind of ornament to life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess had already perceived that he pronounced amiable
&lsquo;emiable&rsquo;; but she had accepted this peculiarity of her visitor in
the spirit of imaginative transfigurement in which she had accepted several
others. &ldquo;To your life, of course. She can hardly be said to be an
ornament to her own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her life and mine are all one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is certainly magnificent,&rdquo; said the Princess. While he was
drinking his tea she remarked to him that for a revolutionist he was certainly
most extraordinary; and he inquired, in answer, whether it were not rather in
keeping for revolutionists to be extraordinary. He drank three cups, declaring
that his hostess&rsquo;s decoction was fine; it was better, even, than Lady
Aurora&rsquo;s. This led him to observe, as he put down his third cup, looking
round the room again, lovingly, almost covetously, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
everything so handy, I don&rsquo;t see what interest you can have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, what interest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In getting in so uncommon deep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the instant the Princess&rsquo;s expression flashed into pure passion.
&ldquo;Do you consider that I am in&mdash;really far?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Up to your neck, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And do you think that <i>il y va</i> of my neck&mdash;I mean that
it&rsquo;s in danger?&rdquo; she translated, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I understand your French. Well, I&rsquo;ll look after you,&rdquo;
Muniment said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember, then, definitely, that I expect not to lie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not even for me?&rdquo; Then Muniment added, in the same familiar tone,
which was not rough nor wanting in respect, but only homely and direct,
suggestive of growing acquaintance, &ldquo;If I was your husband I would come
and take you away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak of my husband,&rdquo; said the Princess,
gravely. &ldquo;You have no qualification for doing so; you know nothing
whatever about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what Hyacinth has told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Hyacinth!&rdquo; the Princess murmured, impatiently. There was
another silence of some minutes, not disconnected, apparently, from this
reference to the little bookbinder; but when Muniment spoke, after the
interval, it was not to carry on the allusion&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you think me very plain, very rude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, you have not such a nice address as Hyacinth,&rdquo; the
Princess rejoined, not desiring, on her side, to evade the topic. &ldquo;But
that is given to very few,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know that
pretty manners are exactly what we are working for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, it won&rsquo;t be very endearing when we cut down a few
allowances,&rdquo; said Muniment. &ldquo;But I want to please you; I want to be
as much as possible like Hyacinth,&rdquo; he went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is not the way to please me. I don&rsquo;t forgive him; he&rsquo;s
very silly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t say that; he&rsquo;s a little brick!&rdquo; Muniment
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dear fellow, with extraordinary qualities, but so
deplorably conventional.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, talking about taking things seriously&mdash;<i>he</i> takes them
seriously,&rdquo; remarked Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he ever told you his life?&rdquo; asked the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t required to tell me. I&rsquo;ve seen a good bit of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I mean before you knew him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment reflected a moment. &ldquo;His birth, and his poor mother? I think it
was Rosy told me about that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, pray, how did <i>she</i> know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, when you come to the way Rosy knows!&rdquo; said Muniment, laughing.
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like people in that predicament. She thinks we ought
all to be finely born.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then they agree, for so does poor Hyacinth.&rdquo; The Princess
hesitated an instant; then she said, as if with a quick effort, &ldquo;I want
to ask you something. Have you had a visit from Mr Vetch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old gentleman who fiddles? No, he has never done me that
honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was because I prevented him, then. I told him to leave it to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To leave what, now?&rdquo; Muniment looked at her in placid perplexity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is in great distress about Hyacinth&mdash;about the danger he runs.
You know what I mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know what you mean,&rdquo; Muniment replied, slowly. &ldquo;But
what does <i>he</i> know about it? I thought it was supposed to be a deadly
secret.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is. He doesn&rsquo;t know anything; he only suspects.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated again. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m like Rosy&mdash;I find out.
Mr Vetch, as I suppose you are aware, has known Hyacinth all his life; he takes
a most affectionate interest in him. He believes there is something hanging
over him, and he wants it to be turned off, to be stopped.&rdquo; The Princess
paused at this, but her visitor made no response, and she continued: &ldquo;He
was going to see you, to beg you to do something, to interfere; he seemed to
think that your power, in such a matter, would be very great; but, as I tell
you, I requested him, as a particular favour to me, to let you alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What favour would it be to you?&rdquo; Muniment asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would give me the satisfaction of feeling that you were not
worried.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment appeared struck with the curious inadequacy of this explanation,
considering what was at stake; he broke into a laugh and remarked, &ldquo;That
was considerate of you, beyond everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was not meant as consideration for you; it was a piece of
calculation.&rdquo; The Princess, having made this announcement, gathered up
her gloves and turned away, walking to the chimney-piece, where she stood a
moment arranging her bonnet-ribbons in the mirror with which it was decorated.
Muniment watched her with evident curiosity; in spite both of his
inaccessibility to nervous agitation and of the sceptical theories he
entertained about her, he was not proof against her general faculty of creating
a feeling of suspense, a tension of interest, on the part of those who
associated with her. He followed her movements, but plainly he didn&rsquo;t
follow her calculations, so that he could only listen more attentively when she
inquired suddenly, &ldquo;Do you know why I asked you to come and see me? Do
you know why I went to see your sister? It was all a plan,&rdquo; said the
Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We hoped it was just an ordinary humane, social impulse,&rdquo; the
young man returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was humane, it was even social, but it was not ordinary. I wanted to
save Hyacinth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To save him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted to be able to talk with you just as I am talking now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was a fine idea!&rdquo; Muniment exclaimed, ingenuously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have an exceeding, a quite inexpressible, regard for him. I have no
patience with some of his opinions, and that is why I permitted myself to say
just now that he is silly. But, after all, the opinions of our friends are not
what we love them for, and therefore I don&rsquo;t see why they should be what
we hate them for. Hyacinth Robinson&rsquo;s nature is singularly generous and
his intelligence very fine, though there <i>are</i> some things that he muddles
up. You just now expressed strongly your own regard for him; therefore we ought
to be perfectly agreed. Agreed, I mean, about getting him out of his
scrape.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment had the air of a man who felt that he must consider a little before he
assented to these successive propositions; it being a limitation of his
intellect that he could not respond without understanding. After a moment he
answered, referring to the Princess&rsquo;s last remark, in which the others
appeared to culminate, and at the same time shaking his head a little and
smiling, &ldquo;His scrape isn&rsquo;t important.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You thought it was when you got him into it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it would give him pleasure,&rdquo; said Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a reason for letting people do what isn&rsquo;t good
for them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking so much about what would be good for him as
about what would be bad for some others. He can do as he likes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to say. They must be persuaded not to call upon
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Persuade them, then, dear madam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I persuade them? If I could, I wouldn&rsquo;t have approached
you. I have no influence, and even if I had my motives would be suspected. You
are the one to interpose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I tell them he funks it?&rdquo; Muniment asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On what ground, then, shall I put it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell them he has changed his opinions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be rather like denouncing him as a traitor, and
doing it hypocritically?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell them then it&rsquo;s simply my wish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do <i>you</i> much good,&rdquo; Muniment said, with his
natural laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will it put me in danger? That&rsquo;s exactly what I want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but as I understand you, you want to suffer <i>for</i> the people,
not by them. You are very fond of Robinson; it couldn&rsquo;t be
otherwise,&rdquo; the young man went on. &ldquo;But you ought to remember that,
in the line you have chosen, our affections, our natural ties, our timidities,
our shrinkings&mdash;&rdquo; His voice had become low and grave, and he paused
a little, while the Princess&rsquo;s deep and lovely eyes, attaching themselves
to his face, showed that in an instant she was affected by this unwonted
adjuration. He spoke now as if he were taking her seriously. &ldquo;All those
things are as nothing, and must never weigh a feather beside our
service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess began to draw on her gloves. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a most
extraordinary man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Rosy tells me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do Hyacinth&rsquo;s job? Because it&rsquo;s better to do my own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, pray, what is your own?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment, with perfect serenity and
good-nature. &ldquo;I expect to be instructed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you taken an oath, like Hyacinth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, madam, the oaths <i>I</i> take I don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said the
young man, gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you . . .!&rdquo; the Princess murmured, with an ambiguous cadence.
She appeared to dismiss the question, but to suggest at the same time that he
was very abnormal. This imputation was further conveyed by the next words she
uttered: &ldquo;And can you see a dear friend whirled away like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this, for the first time, Paul Muniment exhibited a certain irritation.
&ldquo;You had better leave my dear friend to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess, with her eyes still fixed upon him, gave a long, soft sigh.
&ldquo;Well, then, shall we go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment took up his hat again, but he made no movement toward the door.
&ldquo;If you did me the honour to seek my acquaintance, to ask me to come and
see you, only in order to say what you have just said about Hyacinth, perhaps
we needn&rsquo;t carry out the form of going to the place you proposed.
Wasn&rsquo;t this only your pretext?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you <i>are</i> afraid!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed; but in
spite of her exclamation the pair presently went out of the house. They quitted
the door together, after having stood on the step for a moment, looking up and
down, apparently for a cab. So far as the darkness, which was now complete,
permitted the prospect to be scanned, there was no such vehicle within hail.
They turned to the left, and after a walk of several minutes, during which they
were engaged in small, dull by-streets, emerged upon a more populous way, where
there were lighted shops and omnibuses and the evident chance of a hansom. Here
they paused again, and very soon an empty hansom passed, and, at a sign, pulled
up near them. Meanwhile, it should be recorded, they had been followed, at an
interval, by a cautious figure, a person who, in Madeira Crescent, when they
came out of the house, was stationed on the other side of the street, at a
considerable distance. When they appeared he retreated a little, still however
keeping them in sight. When they moved away he moved in the same direction,
watching them but maintaining his distance. He drew nearer, seemingly because
he could not control his eagerness, as they turned into Westbourne Grove, and
during the minute they stood there he was exposed to recognition by the
Princess if she had happened to turn her head. In the event of her having felt
such an impulse she would have discovered, in the lamp-light, that her noble
husband was hovering in her rear. But the Princess was otherwise occupied; she
failed to see that at one moment he came so close as to suggest that he had an
intention of addressing himself to the couple. The reader scarcely needs to be
informed that his real intention was to satisfy himself as to the kind of
person his wife was walking with. The time allowed him for this research was
brief, especially as he had perceived, more rapidly than he sometimes perceived
things, that they were looking for a vehicle and that with its assistance they
would pass out of his range&mdash;a reflection which caused him to give half
his attention to the business of hailing any second cab which should come that
way. There are parts of London in which you may never see a cab at all, but
there are none in which you may see only one; in accordance with which
fortunate truth Prince Casamassima was able to wave his stick to good purpose
as soon as the two objects of his pursuit had rattled away. Behind them now, in
the gloom, he had no fear of being seen. In little more than an instant he had
jumped into another hansom, the driver of which accompanied the usual
exclamation of &ldquo;All right, sir!&rdquo; with a small, amused grunt, which
the Prince thought eminently British, after he had hissed at him, over the
hood, expressively, and in a manner by no means indicative of that nationality,
the injunction, &ldquo;Follow, follow, follow!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3><a name="chap40"></a>XL</h3>

<p>
An hour after the Princess had left the house with Paul Muniment, Madame
Grandoni came down to supper, a meal of which she partook, in gloomy solitude,
in the little back parlour. She had pushed away her plate, and sat motionless,
staring at the crumpled cloth, with her hands folded on the edge of the table,
when she became aware that a gentleman had been ushered into the drawing-room
and was standing before the fire in an attitude of discreet expectancy. At the
same moment the maid-servant approached the old lady, remarking with bated
breath, &ldquo;The Prince, the Prince, mum! It&rsquo;s you he &rsquo;ave asked
for, mum!&rdquo; Upon this, Madame Grandoni called out to the visitor from her
place, addressed him as her poor illustrious friend and bade him come and give
her his arm. He obeyed with solemn alacrity, and conducted her into the front
room, near the fire. He helped her to arrange herself in her arm-chair and to
gather her shawl about her; then he seated himself near her and remained with
his dismal eyes bent upon her. After a moment she said, &ldquo;Tell me
something about Rome. The grass in the Villa Borghese must already be thick
with flowers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would have brought you some, if I had thought,&rdquo; he answered.
Then he turned his gaze about the room. &ldquo;Yes, you may well ask, in such a
black little hole as this. My wife should not live here,&rdquo; he added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear friend, for all that she&rsquo;s your wife!&rdquo; the old
woman exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The Prince sprang up in sudden, passionate agitation, and then she saw that the
rigid quietness with which he had come into the room and greeted her was only
an effort of his good manners. He was really trembling with excitement.
&ldquo;It is true&mdash;it is true! She <i>has</i> lovers&mdash;she <i>has</i>
lovers!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;I have seen it with my eyes, and I have
come here to know!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you have seen, but your coming here to know will
not have helped you much. Besides, if you have seen, you know for yourself. At
any rate, I have ceased to be able to tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are afraid&mdash;you are afraid!&rdquo; cried the visitor, with a
wild accusatory gesture.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni looked up at him with slow speculation. &ldquo;Sit down and be
tranquil, very tranquil. I have ceased to pay attention&mdash;I take no
heed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I do, then,&rdquo; said the Prince, subsiding a little.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know she has gone out to a house, in a horrible quarter,
with a man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it highly probable, dear Prince.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who is he? That&rsquo;s what I want to discover.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I tell you? I haven&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her a moment, with his distended eyes. &ldquo;Dear lady, is that
kind to me, when I have counted on you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I am not kind any more; it&rsquo;s not a question of that. I am
angry&mdash;as angry, almost, as you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you watch her, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not with her I am angry. It&rsquo;s with myself,&rdquo; said
Madame Grandoni, meditatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For becoming so indifferent, do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary, for staying in the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank God, you are still here, or I couldn&rsquo;t have come. But what a
lodging for the Princess!&rdquo; the visitor exclaimed. &ldquo;She might at
least live in a manner befitting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, the last time you were in London you thought it was too
costly!&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Whatever she does is wrong. Is it because
it&rsquo;s so bad that you must go?&rdquo; he went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is foolish&mdash;foolish&mdash;foolish,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni,
slowly, impressively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Foolish, <i>chè, chè!</i> He was in the house nearly an hour, this
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the house? In what house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, where you sit. I saw him go in, and when he came out it was after
a long time, with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where were you, meanwhile?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Prince Casamassima hesitated. &ldquo;I was on the other side of the
street. When they came out I followed them. It was more than an hour
ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it for that you came to London?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, what I came for! To put myself in hell!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had better go back to Rome,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I will go back, but if you will tell me who this one is! How
can you be ignorant, dear friend, when he comes freely in and out of the house
where I have to watch, at the door, for a moment that I can snatch? He was not
the same as the other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As the other?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doubtless there are fifty! I mean the little one whom I met in the other
house, that Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sit in my room almost always now,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;I
only come down to eat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear lady, it would be better if you would sit here,&rdquo; the Prince
remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better for whom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that if you did not withdraw yourself you could at least answer
my questions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but I have not the slightest desire to answer them,&rdquo; Madame
Grandoni replied. &ldquo;You must remember that I am not here as your
spy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Prince, in a tone of extreme and simple melancholy.
&ldquo;If you had given me more information I should not have been obliged to
come here myself. I arrived in London only this morning, and this evening I
spent two hours walking up and down opposite the house, like a groom waiting
for his master to come back from a ride. I wanted a personal impression. It was
so that I saw him come in. He is not a gentleman&mdash;not even like some of
the strange ones here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think he is Scotch,&rdquo; remarked Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, then, you <i>have</i> seen him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but I have heard him. He speaks very loud&mdash;the floors of this
house are not built as we build in Italy&mdash;and his voice is the same that I
have heard in the people of that country. Besides, she has told me&mdash;some
things. He is a chemist&rsquo;s assistant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A chemist&rsquo;s assistant? <i>Santo Dio!</i> And the other one, a year
ago&mdash;more than a year ago&mdash;was a bookbinder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the bookbinder!&rdquo; murmured Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And does she associate with no people of good? Has she no other
society?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For me to tell you more, Prince, you must wait till I am free,&rdquo;
said the old lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, free?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must choose. I must either go away&mdash;and then I can tell you what
I have seen&mdash;or if I stay here I must hold my tongue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you go away you will have seen nothing,&rdquo; the Prince
objected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, plenty as it is&mdash;more than I ever expected to!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince clasped his hands together in tremulous suppliance; but at the same
time he smiled, as if to conciliate, to corrupt. &ldquo;Dearest friend, you
torment my curiosity. If you will tell me this, I will never ask you anything
more. Where did they go? For the love of God, what is that house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing of their houses,&rdquo; she returned, with an impatient
shrug.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then there are others&mdash;there are many?&rdquo; She made no answer,
but sat brooding, with her chin in her protrusive kerchief. Her visitor
presently continued, in a soft, earnest tone, with his beautiful Italian
distinctness, as if his lips cut and carved the sound, while his fine fingers
quivered into quick, emphasising gestures, &ldquo;The street is small and
black, but it is like all the streets. It has no importance; it is at the end
of an endless imbroglio. They drove for twenty minutes; then they stopped their
cab and got out. They went together on foot some minutes more. There were many
turns; they seemed to know them well. For me it was very difficult&mdash;of
course I also got out; I had to stay so far behind&mdash;close against the
houses. Chiffinch Street, N.E.&mdash;that was the name,&rdquo; the Prince
continued, pronouncing the word with difficulty; &ldquo;and the house is number
32&mdash;I looked at that after they went in. It&rsquo;s a very bad
house&mdash;worse than this; but it has no sign of a chemist, and there are no
shops in the street. They rang the bell&mdash;only once, though they waited a
long time; it seemed to me, at least, that they did not touch it again. It was
several minutes before the door was opened; and that was a bad time for me,
because as they stood there they looked up and down. Fortunately you know the
air of this place! I saw no light in the house&mdash;not even after they went
in. Who let them enter I couldn&rsquo;t tell. I waited nearly half an hour, to
see how long they would stay and what they would do on coming out; then, at
last, my impatience brought me here, for to know she was absent made me hope I
might see you. While I was there two persons went in&mdash;two men, together,
smoking, who looked like <i>artisti</i> (I didn&rsquo;t see them near), but no
one came out. I could see they took their cigars&mdash;and you can fancy what
tobacco!&mdash;into the presence of the Princess. Formerly,&rdquo; pursued
Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s visitor, with a touching attempt at a jocular treatment
of this point, &ldquo;she never tolerated smoking&mdash;never mine, at least.
The street is very quiet&mdash;very few people pass. Now what is the house? Is
it where that man lives?&rdquo; he asked, almost in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
He had been encouraged by her consenting, in spite of her first protests, to
listen to him&mdash;he could see she <i>was</i> listening; and he was still
more encouraged when, after a moment, she answered his question by a question
of her own: &ldquo;Did you cross the river to go there? I know that he lives
over the water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, no, it was not in that part. I tried to ask the cabman who brought
me back to explain to me what it is called; but I couldn&rsquo;t make him
understand. They have heavy minds,&rdquo; the Prince declared. Then he pursued,
drawing a little closer to his hostess: &ldquo;But what were they doing there?
Why did she go with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are plotting. There!&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean a secret society, a band of revolutionists and murderers?
<i>Capisco bene</i>&mdash;that is not new to me. But perhaps they only pretend
it&rsquo;s for that,&rdquo; added the Prince.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only pretend? Why should they pretend? That is not Christina&rsquo;s
way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are other possibilities,&rdquo; the Prince observed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course, when your wife goes away with strange men, in the dark,
to far-away houses, you can think anything you like, and I have nothing to say
to your thoughts. I have my own, but they are my own affair, and I shall not
undertake to defend Christina, for she is indefensible. When she does the
things she does, she provokes, she invites, the worst construction; there let
it rest, save for this one remark, which I will content myself with making: if
she were a licentious woman she would not behave as she does now, she would not
expose herself to irresistible interpretations; the appearance of everything
would be good and proper. I simply tell you what I believe. If I believed that
what she is doing concerned you alone, I should say nothing about it&mdash;at
least sitting here. But it concerns others, it concerns every one, so I will
open my mouth at last. She has gone to that house to break up society.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To break it up, yes, as she has wanted before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, more than before! She is very much entangled. She has relations with
people who are watched by the police. She has not told me, but I have perceived
it by simply living with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Prince Casamassima stared. &ldquo;And is <i>she</i> watched by the
police?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you; it is very possible&mdash;except that the police
here is not like that of other countries.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is more stupid,&rdquo; said the Prince. He gazed at Madame Grandoni
with a flush of shame on his face. &ldquo;Will she bring us to <i>that</i>
scandal? It would be the worst of all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is one chance&mdash;the chance that she will get tired of
it,&rdquo; the old lady remarked. &ldquo;Only the scandal may come before
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear friend, she is the devil,&rdquo; said the Prince, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she is not the devil, because she wishes to do good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What good did she ever wish to do to me?&rdquo; the Italian demanded,
with glowing eyes.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni shook her head very sadly. &ldquo;You can do no good, of any
kind, to each other. Each on your own side, you must be quiet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I be quiet when I hear of such infamies?&rdquo; Prince
Casamassima got up, in his violence, and, in a tone which caused his companion
to burst into a short, incongruous laugh as soon as she heard the words,
exclaimed, &ldquo;She shall <i>not</i> break up society!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she will bore herself before the trick is played. Make up your mind
to that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is what I expected to find&mdash;that the caprice was over. She has
passed through so many follies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give her time&mdash;give her time,&rdquo; replied Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Time to drag my name into an assize-court? Those people are robbers,
incendiaries, murderers!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can say nothing to me about them that I haven&rsquo;t said to
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how does she defend herself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Defend herself? Did you ever hear Christina do that?&rdquo; Madame
Grandoni asked. &ldquo;The only thing she says to me is, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid; I promise you by all that&rsquo;s sacred that you shan&rsquo;t
suffer.&rsquo; She speaks as if she had it all in her hands. That is very well.
No doubt I&rsquo;m a selfish old woman, but, after all, one has a heart for
others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so have I, I think I may pretend,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;You
tell me to give her time, and it is certain that she will take it, whether I
give it or not. But I can at least stop giving her money. By heaven, it&rsquo;s
my duty, as an honest man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She tells me that as it is you don&rsquo;t give her much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much, dear lady? It depends on what you call so. It&rsquo;s enough to
make all these scoundrels flock around her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are not all scoundrels, any more than she is. That is the strange
part of it,&rdquo; said the old woman, with a weary sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this fellow, the chemist&mdash;to-night&mdash;what do you call
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has spoken to me of him as a most estimable young man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she thinks it&rsquo;s estimable to blow us all up,&rdquo; the Prince
returned. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t <i>he</i> take her money?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he takes. But there are some things&mdash;heaven
forbid one should forget them! The misery of London is something
fearful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Che vuole?</i> There is misery everywhere,&rdquo; returned the
Prince. &ldquo;It is the will of God. <i>Ci vuol&rsquo; pazienza!</i> And in
this country does no one give alms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every one, I believe. But it appears that it is not enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince said nothing for a moment; this statement of Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s
seemed to present difficulties. The solution, however, soon suggested itself;
it was expressed in the inquiry, &ldquo;What will you have in a country which
has not the true faith?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, the true faith is a great thing; but there is suffering even in
countries that have it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Evidentemente</i>. But it helps suffering to be borne, and, later, it
makes it up; whereas here&mdash;!&rdquo; said the old lady&rsquo;s visitor,
with a melancholy smile. &ldquo;If I may speak of myself, it is to me, in my
circumstances, a support.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
He stood before her, resting his eyes for a moment on the floor. &ldquo;And the
famous Cholto&mdash;Godfrey Gerald&mdash;does he come no more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for months, and know nothing about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like the chemists and the bookbinders, eh?&rdquo; asked
the Prince.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, it was he who first brought them&mdash;to gratify your wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If they have turned him out, then, that is very well. Now, if only some
one could turn <i>them</i> out!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Aspetta, aspetta!</i>&rdquo; said the old woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is very good advice, but to follow it isn&rsquo;t amusing.&rdquo;
Then the Prince added, &ldquo;You alluded, just now, as to something
particular, to <i>quel giovane</i>, the young artisan whom I met in the other
house. Is he also estimable, or has he paid the penalty of his crimes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has paid the penalty, but I don&rsquo;t know of what. I have nothing
bad to tell you of him, except that I think his star is on the wane.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Poverino!</i>&rdquo; the Prince exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is exactly the manner in which I addressed him the first time I saw
him. I didn&rsquo;t know how it would happen, but I felt that it would happen
somehow. It has happened through his changing his opinions. He has now the same
idea as you&mdash;that <i>ci vuol&rsquo; pazienza</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince listened with the same expression of wounded eagerness, the same
parted lips and excited eyes, to every added fact that dropped from Madame
Grandoni&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;That, at least, is more honest. Then <i>he</i>
doesn&rsquo;t go to Chiffinch Street?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Chiffinch Street; but it would be my impression
that he doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere that Christina and the other one&mdash;the
Scotchman&mdash;go together. But these are delicate matters,&rdquo; the old
woman pursued.
</p>

<p>
They seemed much to interest her interlocutor. &ldquo;Do you mean that the
Scotchman is&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;his successor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment Madame Grandoni made no reply. &ldquo;I think that this case is
different. But I don&rsquo;t understand; it was the other, the little one, that
helped her to know the Scotchman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now they have quarrelled&mdash;about my wife? It is all tremendously
edifying!&rdquo; the Prince exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, and shouldn&rsquo;t have attempted it, only that
Assunta talks to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish she would talk to me,&rdquo; said the Prince, wistfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my friend, if Christina were to find you getting at her
servants!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could it be worse for me than it is now? However, I don&rsquo;t know
why I speak as if I cared, for I don&rsquo;t care any more. I have given her
up. It is finished.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni, gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You yourself made the distinction, perfectly. So long as she endeavoured
only to injure <i>me</i>, and in my private capacity, I could condone, I could
wait, I could hope. But since she has so recklessly thrown herself into the
most criminal undertakings, since she lifts her hand with a determined purpose,
as you tell me, against the most sacred institutions&mdash;it is too much; ah,
yes, it is too much! She may go her way; she is no wife of mine. Not another
penny of mine shall go into her pocket, and into that of the wretches who prey
upon her, who have corrupted her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Prince, I think you are right. And yet I am sorry!&rdquo; sighed
the old woman, extending her hand for assistance to rise from her chair.
&ldquo;If she becomes really poor, it will be much more difficult for me to
leave her. <i>This</i> is not poverty, and not even a good imitation of it, as
she would like it to be. But what will be said of me if having remained with
her through so much of her splendour, I turn away from her the moment she
begins to want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear lady, do you ask that to make me relent?&rdquo; the Prince
inquired, after an hesitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least; for whatever is said and whatever you do, there is
nothing for me in decency, at present, but to pack my trunk. Judge, by the way
I have tattled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you will stay on, she shall have everything.&rdquo; The Prince spoke
in a very low tone, with a manner that betrayed the shame he felt at his
attempt at bribery.
</p>

<p>
Madame Grandoni gave him an astonished glance and moved away from him.
&ldquo;What does that mean? I thought you didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I know not what explanation of his inconsequence her companion would have given
her if at that moment the door of the room had not been pushed open to permit
the entrance of Hyacinth Robinson. He stopped short on perceiving that Madame
Grandoni had a visitor, but before he had time to say anything the old lady
addressed him with a certain curtness: &ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t fall well;
the Princess isn&rsquo;t at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was mentioned to me, but I ventured to come in to see you, as I
have done before,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied. Then he added, as if he were
retreating, &ldquo;I beg many pardons. I was not told that you were not
alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My visitor is going, but I am going too,&rdquo; said Madame Grandoni.
&ldquo;I must take myself to my room&mdash;I am all falling to pieces.
Therefore kindly excuse me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had had time to recognise the Prince, and this nobleman paid him the
same compliment, as was proved by his asking of Madame Grandoni, in a rapid
aside, in Italian, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the bookbinder?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Sicuro</i>,&rdquo; said the old lady; while Hyacinth, murmuring a
regret that he should find her indisposed, turned back to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One moment&mdash;one moment, I pray!&rdquo; the Prince interposed,
raising his hand persuasively and looking at him with an unexpected,
exaggerated smile. &ldquo;Please introduce me to the gentleman,&rdquo; he
added, in English, to Madame Grandoni.
</p>

<p>
She manifested no surprise at the request&mdash;she had none left, apparently,
for anything&mdash;but pronounced the name of Prince Casamassima, and then
added, for Hyacinth&rsquo;s benefit, &ldquo;He knows who you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you permit me to keep you a very little minute?&rdquo; the Prince
continued, addressing the other visitor; after which he remarked to Madame
Grandoni, &ldquo;I will speak with him a little. It is perhaps not necessary
that we should incommode you, if you do not wish to stay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had for a moment, as she tossed off a satirical little laugh, a return of
her ancient drollery: &ldquo;Remember that if you talk long she may come back!
Yes, yes, I will go upstairs. <i>Felicissima notte, signori!</i>&rdquo; She
took her way to the door, which Hyacinth, considerably bewildered, held open
for her.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for which Prince Casamassima wished to converse with him were
mysterious; nevertheless, he was about to close the door behind Madame
Grandoni, as a sign that he was at the service of her companion. At this moment
the latter extended again a courteous, remonstrant hand. &ldquo;After all, as
my visit is finished and as yours comes to nothing, might we not go out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, I will go with you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth. He spoke with an
instinctive stiffness, in spite of the Prince&rsquo;s queer affability, and in
spite also of the fact that he felt sorry for the nobleman, to whose
countenance Madame Grandoni&rsquo;s last injunction, uttered in English, had
brought a deep and painful blush. It is needless to go into the question of
what Hyacinth, face to face with an aggrieved husband, may have had on his
conscience, but he assumed, naturally enough, that the situation might be
grave, though indeed the Prince&rsquo;s manner was, for the moment,
incongruously conciliatory. Hyacinth invited his new acquaintance to pass, and
in a minute they were in the street together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you go here&mdash;do you go there?&rdquo; the Prince inquired, as
they stood a moment before the house. &ldquo;If you will permit, I will take
the same direction.&rdquo; On Hyacinth&rsquo;s answering that it was
indifferent to him the Prince said, turning to the right, &ldquo;Well, then,
here, but slowly, if that pleases you, and only a little way.&rdquo; His
English was far from perfect, but his errors were mainly errors of
pronunciation, and Hyacinth was struck with his effort to express himself very
distinctly, so that in intercourse with a little representative of the British
populace his foreignness should not put him at a disadvantage. Quick as he was
to perceive and appreciate, Hyacinth noted how a certain quality of breeding
that was in his companion enabled him to compass that coolness, and he mentally
applauded his success in a difficult feat. Difficult he judged it because it
seemed to him that the purpose for which the Prince wished to speak to him was
one which must require a deal of explanation, and it was a sign of training to
explain adequately, in a foreign tongue, especially if one were agitated, to a
person in a social position very different from one&rsquo;s own. Hyacinth knew
what the Prince&rsquo;s estimate of <i>his</i> importance must be (he could
have no illusions as to the character of the people his wife received); but
while he heard him carefully put one word after the other he was able to smile
to himself at his needless precautions. Hyacinth reflected that at a pinch he
could have encountered him in his own tongue; during his stay at Venice he had
picked up an Italian vocabulary. &ldquo;With Madame Grandoni I spoke of
you,&rdquo; the Prince announced, dispassionately, as they walked along.
&ldquo;She told me a thing that interested me,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;that is
why I walk with you.&rdquo; Hyacinth said nothing, deeming that better by
silence than in any other fashion he held himself at the disposal of his
interlocutor. &ldquo;She told me you have changed&mdash;you have no more the
same opinions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The same opinions?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About the arrangement of society. You desire no more the assassination
of the rich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never desired any such thing!&rdquo; said Hyacinth, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if you have changed, you can confess,&rdquo; the Prince rejoined, in
an encouraging tone. &ldquo;It is very good for some people to be rich. It
would not be right for all to be poor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be pleasant if all could be rich,&rdquo; Hyacinth suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but not by stealing and shooting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not by stealing and shooting. I never desired that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, no doubt she was mistaken. But to-day you think we must have
patience,&rdquo; the Prince went on, as if he hoped very much that Hyacinth
would allow this valuable conviction to be attributed to him. &ldquo;That is
also my view.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, we must have patience,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, who was now
smiling to himself in the dark.
</p>

<p>
They had by this time reached the end of the little Crescent, where the Prince
paused under the street-lamp. He considered Hyacinth&rsquo;s countenance for a
moment by its help, and then he pronounced, &ldquo;If I am not mistaken, you
know very well the Princess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment. &ldquo;She has been very kind to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is my wife&mdash;perhaps you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Hyacinth hesitated, but after a moment he replied, &ldquo;She has told me
that she is married.&rdquo; As soon as he had spoken these words he thought
them idiotic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean you would not know if she had not told you, I suppose.
Evidently, there is nothing to show it. You can think if that is agreeable to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t think, I can&rsquo;t judge,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are right&mdash;that is impossible.&rdquo; The Prince stood before
his companion, and in the pale gaslight the latter saw more of his face. It had
an unnatural expression, a look of wasted anxiety; the eyes seemed to glitter,
and Hyacinth conceived the unfortunate nobleman to be feverish and ill. He
continued in a moment: &ldquo;Of course you think it strange&mdash;my
conversation. I want you to tell me something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid you are very unwell,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am unwell; but I shall be better if you will tell me. It is
because you have come back to good ideas&mdash;that is why I ask you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A sense that the situation of the Princess&rsquo;s husband was really pitiful,
that at any rate he suffered and was helpless, that he was a gentleman and even
a person who would never have done any great harm&mdash;a perception of these
appealing truths came into Hyacinth&rsquo;s heart, and stirred there a desire
to be kind to him, to render him any service that, in reason, he might ask. It
appeared to Hyacinth that he must be pretty sick to ask any service at all, but
that was his own affair. &ldquo;If you would like me to see you safely home, I
will do that,&rdquo; our young man remarked; and even while he spoke he was
struck with the oddity of his being already on such friendly terms with a
person whom he had hitherto supposed to be the worst enemy of the rarest of
women. He found himself unable to consider the Prince with resentment.
</p>

<p>
This personage acknowledged the civility of his offer with a slight inclination
of his high slimness. &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, but I will not go
home. I will not go home till I know this&mdash;to what house she has gone.
Will you tell me that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To what house?&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has gone with a person whom you know. Madame Grandoni told me that.
He is a Scotch chemist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Scotch chemist?&rdquo; Hyacinth stared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw them myself&mdash;two hours, three hours, ago. Listen, listen; I
will be very clear,&rdquo; said the Prince, laying his forefinger on the other
hand with an explanatory gesture. &ldquo;He came to that house&mdash;this one,
where we have been, I mean&mdash;and stayed there a long time. I was here in
the street&mdash;I have passed my day in the street! They came out together,
and I watched them, I followed them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had listened with wonder, and even with suspense; the Prince&rsquo;s
manner gave an air of such importance, such mystery, to what he had to relate.
But at this he broke out: &ldquo;This is not my business&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
hear it! <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t watch, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t follow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince stared a moment, in surprise; then he rejoined, more quickly than he
had spoken yet, &ldquo;But they went to a house where they conspire, where they
prepare horrible acts. How can you like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know it, sir?&rdquo; Hyacinth inquired, gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is Madame Grandoni who has told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, then, do you ask me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I am not sure, I don&rsquo;t think she knows. I want to know
more, to be sure of what is done in that house. Does she go there only for the
revolution,&rdquo; the Prince demanded, &ldquo;or does she go there to be alone
with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With <i>him?</i>&rdquo; The Prince&rsquo;s tone and his excited eyes
infused a kind of vividness into the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With the tall man&mdash;the chemist. They got into a hansom together;
the house is far away, in the lost quarters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth drew himself together. &ldquo;I know nothing about the matter, and I
don&rsquo;t care. If that is all you wish to ask me, we had better
separate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince&rsquo;s face elongated; it seemed to grow paler. &ldquo;Then it is
not true that you hate those abominations!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment. &ldquo;How can you know about my opinions? How can
they interest you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prince looked at him with sick eyes; he raised his arms a moment, a certain
distance, and then let them drop at his sides. &ldquo;I hoped you would help
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When we are in trouble we can&rsquo;t help each other much!&rdquo; our
young man exclaimed. But this austere reflection was lost upon the Prince, who
at the moment Hyacinth spoke had already turned to look in the direction from
which they had proceeded, the other end of the Crescent, his attention
apparently being called thither by the sound of a rapid hansom. The place was
still and empty, and the wheels of this vehicle reverberated. The Prince peered
at it through the darkness, and in an instant he cried, under his breath,
excitedly, &ldquo;They have come back&mdash;they have come back! Now you can
see&mdash;yes, the two!&rdquo; The hansom had slackened pace and pulled up; the
house before which it stopped was clearly the house the two men had lately
quitted. Hyacinth felt his arm seized by the Prince, who, hastily, by a strong
effort, drew him forward several yards. At this moment a part of the agitation
that possessed the unhappy Italian seemed to pass into his own blood; a wave of
anxiety rushed through him&mdash;anxiety as to the relations of the two persons
who had descended from the cab; he had, in short, for several instants, a very
exact revelation of the state of feeling of a jealous husband. If he had been
told, half an hour before, that he was capable of surreptitious peepings, in
the interest of such jealousy, he would have resented the insult; yet he
allowed himself to be checked by his companion just at the nearest point at
which they might safely consider the proceedings of the couple who alighted. It
was in fact the Princess, accompanied by Paul Muniment. Hyacinth noticed that
the latter paid the cabman, who immediately drove away, from his own pocket. He
stood with the Princess for some minutes at the door of the house&mdash;minutes
during which Hyacinth felt his heart beat insanely, ignobly, he couldn&rsquo;t
tell why.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does he say? what does <i>she</i> say?&rdquo; hissed the Prince;
and when he demanded, the next moment, &ldquo;Will he go in again, or will he
go away?&rdquo; our sensitive youth felt that a voice was given to his own most
eager thought. The pair were talking together, with rapid sequences, and as the
door had not yet been opened it was clear that, to prolong the conversation on
the steps, the Princess delayed to ring. &ldquo;It will make three, four, hours
he has been with her,&rdquo; moaned the Prince.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He may be with her fifty hours!&rdquo; Hyacinth answered, with a laugh,
turning away, ashamed of himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has gone in&mdash;<i>sangue di Dio!</i>&rdquo; cried the Prince,
catching his companion again by the arm and making him look. All that Hyacinth
saw was the door just closing; the Princess and Muniment were on the other side
of it. &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> for the revolution?&rdquo; the trembling nobleman
panted. But Hyacinth made no answer; he only gazed at the closed door an
instant, and then, disengaging himself, walked straight away, leaving the
Italian, in the darkness, to direct a great helpless, futile shake of his stick
at the indifferent house.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth waited a long time, but when at last Millicent came to the door the
splendour of her appearance did much to justify her delay. He heard an immense
rustling on the staircase, accompanied by a creaking of that inexpensive
structure, and then she brushed forward into the narrow, dusky passage where he
had been standing for a quarter of an hour. She looked flushed; she exhaled a
strong, cheap perfume; and she instantly thrust her muff, a tight, fat,
beribboned receptacle, at him, to be held while she adjusted her gloves to her
large vulgar hands. Hyacinth opened the door&mdash;it was so natural an
assumption that they would not be able to talk properly in the
passage&mdash;and they came out to the low steps, lingering there in the yellow
Sunday sunshine. A loud ejaculation on the beauty of the day broke from
Millicent, though, as we know, she was not addicted to facile admirations. The
winter was not over, but the spring had begun, and the smoky London air allowed
the baffled citizens, by way of a change, to see through it. The town could
refresh its recollections of the sky, and the sky could ascertain the
geographical position of the town. The essential dimness of the low
perspectives had by no means disappeared, but it had loosened its folds; it
lingered as a blur of mist, interwoven with pretty sun-tints and faint
transparencies. There was warmth and there was light, and a view of the
shutters of shops, and the church bells were ringing. Miss Henning remarked
that it was a &lsquo;shime&rsquo; she couldn&rsquo;t have a place to ask a
gentleman to sit down; but what were you to do when you had such a grind for
your living, and a room, to keep yourself tidy, no bigger than a pill-box? She
couldn&rsquo;t, herself, abide waiting outside; she knew something about it
when she took things home to ladies to choose (the time they spent was long
enough to choose a husband!) and it always made her feel quite miserable. It
was something cruel. If she could have what she liked she knew what she would
have; and she hinted at a mystic bower where a visitor could sit and enjoy
himself&mdash;with the morning paper, or a nice view out of the window, or even
a glass of sherry&mdash;so that, in an adjacent apartment, she could dress
without getting in a fidget, which always made her red in the face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I <i>&rsquo;ave</i> pitched on my things,&rdquo;
she remarked, presenting her magnificence to Hyacinth, who became aware that
she had put a small plump book into her muff. He explained that, the day being
so fine, he had come to propose to her to take a walk with him, in the manner
of ancient times. They might spend an hour or two in the Park and stroll beside
the Serpentine, or even paddle about on it, if she liked, and watch the
lambkins, or feed the ducks, if she would put a crust in her pocket. The
prospect of paddling Miss Henning entirely declined; she had no idea of wetting
her flounces, and she left those rough pleasures, especially of a Sunday, to a
lower class of young woman. But she didn&rsquo;t mind if she did go for a turn,
though he didn&rsquo;t deserve any such favour, after the way he hadn&rsquo;t
been near her, if she had died in her garret. She was not one that was to be
dropped and taken up at any man&rsquo;s convenience&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t keep
one of those offices for servants out of place. Millicent expressed the belief
that if the day had not been so lovely she would have sent Hyacinth about his
business; it was lucky for him that she was always forgiving such was her
sensitive, generous nature) when the sun was out. Only there was one
thing&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t abide making no difference for Sunday; it was
her personal habit to go to church, and she should have it on her conscience if
she gave it up for a lark. Hyacinth had already been impressed, more than once,
by the manner in which his blooming friend stickled for the religious
observance: of all the queer disparities of her nature, her devotional turn
struck him as perhaps the queerest. She held her head erect through the longest
and dullest sermon, and came out of the place of worship with her fine face
embellished by the publicity of her virtue. She was exasperated by the general
secularity of Hyacinth&rsquo;s behaviour, especially taken in conjunction with
his general straightness, and was only consoled a little by the fact that if he
didn&rsquo;t drink, or fight, or steal, at least he indulged in unlimited
wickedness of opinion&mdash;theories as bad as anything that people got ten
years for. Hyacinth had not yet revealed to her that his theories had somehow
lately come to be held with less tension; an instinct of kindness had forbidden
him to deprive her of a grievance which ministered so much to sociability. He
had not reflected that she would have been more aggrieved, and consequently
more delightful, if her condemnation of his godlessness had been deprived of
confirmatory indications.
</p>

<p>
On the present occasion she let him know that she would go for a walk with him
if he would first accompany her to church; and it was in vain he represented to
her that this proceeding would deprive them of their morning, inasmuch as after
church she would have to dine, and in the interval there would be no time left.
She replied, with a toss of her head, that she dined when she liked; besides on
Sundays she had cold fare&mdash;it was left out for her; an argument to which
Hyacinth had to assent, his ignorance of her domestic economy being complete,
thanks to the maidenly mystery, the vagueness of reference and explanation, in
which, in spite of great freedom of complaint, perpetual announcements of
intended change, impending promotion and high bids for her services in other
quarters, she had always enshrouded her private affairs. Hyacinth walked by her
side to the place of worship she preferred&mdash;her choice was made apparently
from a large experience; and as they went he remarked that it was a good job he
wasn&rsquo;t married to her. Lord, how she would bully him, how she would
&lsquo;squeeze&rsquo; him, in such a case! The worst of it would be
that&mdash;such was his amiable, peace-loving nature&mdash;he would obey like a
showman&rsquo;s poodle. And pray, whom was a man to obey, asked Millicent, if
he was not to obey his wife? She sat up in her pew with a majesty that carried
out this idea; she seemed to answer, in her proper person, for creeds and
communions and sacraments; she was more than devotional, she was almost
pontifical. Hyacinth had never felt himself under such distinguished
protection; the Princess Casamassima came back to him, in comparison, as a
Bohemian, a shabby adventuress. He had come to see her to-day not for the sake
of her austerity (he had had too gloomy a week for that), but for that of her
genial side; yet now that she treated him to the severer spectacle it struck
him for the moment as really grand sport&mdash;a kind of magnification of her
rich vitality. She had her phases and caprices, like the Princess herself; and
if they were not the same as those of the lady of Madeira Crescent they proved
at least that she was as brave a woman. No one but a capital girl could give
herself such airs; she would have a consciousness of the large reserve of
pliancy required for making up for them. The Princess wished to destroy society
and Millicent wished to uphold it; and as Hyacinth, by the side of his
childhood&rsquo;s friend, listened to practised intonings, he was obliged to
recognise the liberality of a fate which had sometimes appeared invidious. He
had been provided with the best opportunities for choosing between the beauty
of the original and the beauty of the conventional.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, on this particular Sunday, there was no sermon (fortunately, I
mean, from the point of view of Hyacinth&rsquo;s heretical impatience), so that
after the congregation dispersed there was still plenty of time for a walk in
the Park. Our friends traversed that barely-interrupted expanse of
irrepressible herbage which stretches from the Birdcage Walk to Hyde Park
Corner, and took their way to Kensington Gardens, beside the Serpentine. Once
Millicent&rsquo;s religious exercises were over for the day (she as rigidly
forbore to repeat them in the afternoon as she made a point of the first
service), once she had lifted her voice in prayer and praise, she changed her
<i>allure;</i> moving to a different measure, uttering her sentiments in a
high, free manner, and not minding that it should be perceived that she had on
her very best gown and was out, if need be, for the day. She was mainly
engaged, for some time, in overhauling Hyacinth for his long absence,
demanding, as usual, some account of what he had been &lsquo;up to&rsquo;. He
listened to her philosophically, liking and enjoying her chaff, which seemed to
him, oddly enough, wholesome and refreshing, and absolutely declining to
satisfy her. He remarked, as he had had occasion to do before, that if he asked
no explanations of her the least he had a right to expect in return was that
she should let him off as easily; and even the indignation with which she
received this plea did not make him feel that an <i>éclaircissement</i> between
them could be a serious thing. There was nothing to explain and nothing to
forgive; they were a pair of very fallible individuals, united much more by
their weaknesses than by any consistency or fidelity that they might pretend to
practise toward each other. It was an old acquaintance&mdash;the oldest thing,
to-day, except Mr Vetch&rsquo;s friendship, in Hyacinth&rsquo;s life; and
strange as this may appear, it inspired our young man with a kind of indulgent
piety. The probability that Millicent &lsquo;kept company&rsquo; with other men
had quite ceased to torment his imagination; it was no longer necessary to his
happiness to be certain about it in order that he might dismiss her from his
mind. He could be as happy without it as with it, and he felt a new modesty in
regard to prying into her affairs. He was so little in a position to be stern
with her that her assumption that he recognised a right on her own part to
chide him seemed to him only a part of her perpetual clumsiness&mdash;a
clumsiness that was not soothing but was nevertheless, in its rich spontaneity,
one of the things he liked her for.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you have come to see me only to make jokes at my expense, you had
better have stayed away altogether,&rdquo; she said, with dignity, as they came
out of the Green Park. &ldquo;In the first place it&rsquo;s rude, in the second
place it&rsquo;s silly, and in the third place I see through you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Millicent, the motions you go through, the resentment you
profess, are purely perfunctory,&rdquo; her companion replied. &ldquo;But it
doesn&rsquo;t matter; go on&mdash;say anything you like. I came to see you for
recreation, for a little entertainment without effort of my own. I scarcely
ventured to hope, however, that you would make me laugh&mdash;I have been so
dismal for a long time. In fact, I am dismal still. I wish I had your
disposition! My mirth is feverish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first thing I require of any friend is that he should respect
me,&rdquo; Miss Henning announced. &ldquo;You lead a bad life. I know what to
think about that,&rdquo; she continued, irrelevantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And is it out of respect for you that you wish me to lead a better one?
To-day, then, is so much saved out of my wickedness. Let us get on the
grass,&rdquo; Hyacinth continued; &ldquo;it is innocent and pastoral to feel it
under one&rsquo;s feet. It&rsquo;s jolly to be with you; you understand
everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand everything you say, but I understand everything
you hide,&rdquo; the young woman returned, as the great central expanse of Hyde
Park, looking intensely green and browsable, stretched away before them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I shall soon become a mystery to you, for I mean from this time
forth to cease to seek safety in concealment. You&rsquo;ll know nothing about
me then, for it will be all under your nose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing so pretty as nature,&rdquo; Millicent
observed, surveying the smutty sheep who find pasturage in the fields that
extend from Knightsbridge to the Bayswater Road. &ldquo;What will you do when
you&rsquo;re so bad you can&rsquo;t go to the shop?&rdquo; she added, with a
sudden transition. And when he asked why he should ever be so bad as that, she
said she could see he <i>was</i> in a fever; she hadn&rsquo;t noticed it at
first, because he never had had any more complexion than a cheese. Was it
something he had caught in some of those back slums, where he went prying about
with his wicked ideas? It served him right for taking as little good into such
places as ever came out of them. Would his fine friends&mdash;a precious lot
<i>they</i> were, that put it off on him to do all the nasty part!&mdash;would
they find the doctor, and the port wine, and the money, and all the rest, when
he was laid up&mdash;perhaps for months&mdash;through their putting such rot
into his head and his putting it into others that could carry it even less?
Millicent stopped on the grass, in the watery sunshine, and bent on her
companion an eye in which he perceived, freshly, an awakened curiosity, a
friendly, reckless ray, a pledge of substantial comradeship. Suddenly she
exclaimed, quitting the tone of exaggerated derision which she had used a
moment before, &ldquo;You little rascal, you&rsquo;ve got something on your
heart! Has your Princess given you the sack?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor girl, your talk is a queer mixture,&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured.
&ldquo;But it may well be. It is not queerer than my life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you admit that!&rdquo; the young woman cried,
walking on with a flutter of her ribbons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your ideas about my ideas!&rdquo; Hyacinth continued. &ldquo;Yes, you
should see me in the back slums. I&rsquo;m a bigger Philistine than you, Miss
Henning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got more ridiculous names, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. I
don&rsquo;t believe that half the time you know what you do mean, yourself. I
don&rsquo;t believe you even know, with all your thinking, what you do think.
That&rsquo;s your disease.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s astonishing how you sometimes put your finger on the
place,&rdquo; Hyacinth rejoined. &ldquo;I mean to think no more&mdash;I mean to
give it up. Avoid it yourself, my dear Millicent&mdash;avoid it as you would a
baleful vice. It confers no true happiness. Let us live in the world of
irreflective contemplation&mdash;let us live in the present hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how I live, nor where I live,&rdquo; said Millicent,
&ldquo;so long as I can do as I like. It&rsquo;s them that are over
you&mdash;it&rsquo;s them that cut it fine! But you never were really
satisfactory to me&mdash;not as one friend should be to another,&rdquo; she
pursued, reverting irresistibly to the concrete and turning still upon her
companion that fine fairness which had no cause to shrink from a daylight
exhibition. &ldquo;Do you remember that day I came back to Lomax Place ever so
long ago, and called on poor dear Miss Pynsent (she couldn&rsquo;t abide me;
she didn&rsquo;t like my form), and waited till you came in, and went out for a
walk with you, and had tea at a coffee-shop? Well, I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you that you weren&rsquo;t satisfactory to me then, and that I consider myself
remarkably good-natured, ever since, to have kept you so little up to the mark.
You always tried to carry it off as if you were telling one everything, and you
never told one nothing at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it you want me to tell, my dear child?&rdquo; Hyacinth inquired,
putting his hand into her arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you anything you
like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll tell me a lot of trash! Certainly, I tried
kindness,&rdquo; Miss Henning declared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Try it again; don&rsquo;t give it up,&rdquo; said her companion,
strolling along with her in close association.
</p>

<p>
She stopped short, detaching herself, though not with intention. &ldquo;Well,
then, has she&mdash;<i>has</i> she chucked you over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth turned his eyes away; he looked at the green expanse, misty and sunny,
dotted with Sunday-keeping figures which made it seem larger; at the wooded
boundary of the Park, beyond the grassy moat of Kensington Gardens; at a
shining reach of the Serpentine on one side and the far façades of Bayswater,
brightened by the fine weather and the privilege of their view, on the other.
&ldquo;Well, you know I rather think so,&rdquo; he replied, in a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, the nasty brute!&rdquo; cried Millicent, as they resumed their walk.
</p>

<p>
Upwards of an hour later they were sitting under the great trees of Kensington
Gardens, those scattered over the slope which rises gently from the side of the
water most distant from the old red palace. They had taken possession of a
couple of the chairs placed there for the convenience of that part of the
public for which a penny is not, as the French say, an affair, and Millicent,
of whom such speculations were highly characteristic, had devoted considerable
conjecture to the question whether the functionary charged with collecting the
said penny would omit to come and ask for his fee. Miss Henning liked to enjoy
her pleasures <i>gratis</i>, as well as to see others do so, and even that of
sitting in a penny chair could touch her more deeply in proportion as she might
feel that nothing would be paid for it. The man came round, however, and after
that her pleasure could only take the form of sitting as long as possible, to
recover her money. This question had been settled, and two or three others, of
a much weightier kind, had come up. At the moment we again participate in the
conversation of the pair Millicent was leaning forward, earnest and attentive,
with her hands clasped in her lap and her multitudinous silver bracelets
tumbled forward upon her wrists. Her face, with its parted lips and eyes
clouded to gentleness, wore an expression which Hyacinth had never seen there
before and which caused him to say to her, &ldquo;After all, dear Milly,
you&rsquo;re a good old fellow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you never tell me before&mdash;years ago?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always soon enough to commit an imbecility! I don&rsquo;t
know why I tell you to-day, sitting here in a charming place, in balmy air,
amid pleasing suggestions, without any reason or practical end. The story is
hideous, and I have held my tongue for so long! It would have been an effort,
an impossible effort, at any time, to do otherwise. Somehow, to-day it
hasn&rsquo;t been an effort; and indeed I have spoken just <i>because</i> the
air is sweet, and the place ornamental, and the day a holiday, and your company
exhilarating. All this has had the effect that an object has if you plunge it
into a cup of water&mdash;the water overflows. Only in my case it&rsquo;s not
water, but a very foul liquid indeed. Excuse the bad odour!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There had been a flush of excitement in Millicent&rsquo;s face while she
listened to what had gone before; it lingered there, and as a colour heightened
by emotion is never unbecoming to a handsome woman, it enriched her exceptional
expression. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so rough with you,&rdquo; she
presently remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear lass, <i>this</i> isn&rsquo;t rough!&rdquo; her companion
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all of a tremble.&rdquo; She put out her hand and laid it
on his own, as if she had been a nurse feeling his pulse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely. I&rsquo;m a nervous little beast,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any one would be nervous, to think of anything so awful. And when
it&rsquo;s yourself!&rdquo; And the girl&rsquo;s manner represented the
dreadfulness of such a contingency. &ldquo;You require sympathy,&rdquo; she
added, in a tone that made Hyacinth smile; the words sounded like a medical
prescription.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A tablespoonful every half-hour,&rdquo; he rejoined, keeping her hand,
which she was about to draw away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would have been nicer, too,&rdquo; Millicent went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, I would have been nicer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I like you now,&rdquo; said Miss Henning. And this time she drew
away her hand, as if, after such a speech, to recover her dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity I have always been so terribly under the influence of
women,&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured, folding his arms.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised at the delicacy with which Millicent replied: &ldquo;You must
remember that they have a great deal to make up to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean for my mother? Ah, <i>she</i> would have made it up, if they
had let her! But the sex in general have been very nice to me,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful the kindness they have shown me, and the
amount of pleasure I have derived from their society.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It would perhaps be inquiring too closely to consider whether this reference to
sources of consolation other than those that sprang from her own bosom had an
irritating effect on Millicent; at all events after a moment&rsquo;s silence
she answered it by asking, &ldquo;Does <i>she</i> know&mdash;your trumpery
Princess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but she doesn&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most uncommonly kind of her!&rdquo; cried the girl, with a
scornful laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It annoys me very much to hear you apply invidious epithets to her. You
know nothing about her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know what I know, please?&rdquo; Millicent asked this
question with the habit of her natural pugnacity, but the next instant she
dropped her voice, as if she remembered that she was in the presence of a great
misfortune. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she treated you most shamefully, and you such a
regular dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least. It is I that, as you may say, have rounded on her. She
made my acquaintance because I was interested in the same things as she was.
Her interest has continued, has increased, but mine, for some reason or other,
has declined. She has been consistent, and I have been fickle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your interest has declined, in the Princess?&rdquo; Millicent
questioned, following imperfectly this somewhat complicated statement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, no. I mean only in some views that I used to have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, when you thought everything should go to the lowest! That&rsquo;s a
good job!&rdquo; Miss Henning exclaimed, with an indulgent laugh, as if, after
all, Hyacinth&rsquo;s views and the changes in his views were not what was most
important. &ldquo;And your grand lady still holds for the costermongers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She wants to take hold of the great question of material misery; she
wants to do something to make that misery less. I don&rsquo;t care for her
means, I don&rsquo;t like her processes. But when I think of what there is to
be done, and of the courage and devotion of those that set themselves to do it,
it seems to me sometimes that with my reserves and scruples I&rsquo;m a very
poor creature.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a poor creature&mdash;to sit there and put such
accusations on yourself!&rdquo; the girl flashed out. &ldquo;If you
haven&rsquo;t a spirit for yourself, I promise you I&rsquo;ve got one for you!
If she hasn&rsquo;t chucked you over why in the name of common sense did you
say just now that she has? And why is your dear old face as white as my
stocking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth looked at her awhile without answering, as if he took a placid
pleasure in her violence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put out her hand and took possession of his own; for a minute she held it,
as if she wished to check herself, finding some influence in his touch that
would help her. They sat in silence, looking at the ornamental water and the
landscape-gardening beyond, which was reflected in it; until Millicent turned
her eyes again upon her companion and remarked, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the
way I&rsquo;d have served him too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It took him a moment to perceive that she was alluding to the vengeance wrought
upon Lord Frederick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of that; you&rsquo;ll never again
hear a word about it on my lips. It&rsquo;s all darkness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always knew you were a gentleman,&rdquo; the girl went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A queer variety, <i>cara mia</i>,&rdquo; her companion rejoined, not
very candidly, as we know the theories he himself had cultivated on this point.
&ldquo;Of course you had heard poor Pinnie&rsquo;s incurable indiscretions.
They used to exasperate me when she was alive, but I forgive her now.
It&rsquo;s time I should, when I begin to talk myself. I think I&rsquo;m
breaking up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t Miss Pynsent; it was just yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray, what did I ever say, in those days?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t what you said,&rdquo; Millicent answered, with
refinement. &ldquo;I guessed the whole business&mdash;except, of course, what
she got her time for, and you being taken to that death-bed&mdash;that day I
came back to the Place. Couldn&rsquo;t you see I was turning it over? And did I
ever throw it up at you, whatever high words we might have had? Therefore what
I say now is no more than I thought then; it only makes you nicer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was crude, she was common, she even had the vice of unskillful
exaggeration, for he himself honestly could not understand how the situation he
had described could make him nicer. But when the faculty of affection that was
in her rose, as it were, to the surface, it diffused a sense of rest, almost of
protection, deepening, at any rate, the luxury of the balmy holiday, the
interlude in the grind of the week&rsquo;s work; so that, though neither of
them had dined, Hyacinth would have been delighted to sit with her there the
whole afternoon. It seemed a pause in something bitter that was happening to
him, making it stop awhile or pushing it off to a distance. His thoughts
hovered about that with a pertinacity of which they themselves were weary; but
they regarded it now with a kind of wounded indifference. It would be too much,
no doubt, to say that Millicent&rsquo;s society appeared a compensation, but it
seemed at least a resource. She too, evidently, was highly content; she made no
proposal to retrace their steps. She interrogated him about his father&rsquo;s
family, and whether they were going to let him go on like that always, without
ever holding out so much as a little finger to him; and she declared, in a
manner that was meant to gratify him by the indignation it conveyed, though the
awkwardness of the turn made him smile, that if she were one of them she
couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;abear&rsquo; the thought of a relation of hers being in
such a poor way. Hyacinth already knew what Miss Henning thought of his
business at old Crookenden&rsquo;s and of the feebleness of a young man of his
parts contenting himself with a career which was after all a mere getting of
one&rsquo;s living by one&rsquo;s &rsquo;ands. He had to do with books; but so
had any shop-boy who should carry such articles to the residence of purchasers;
and plainly Millicent had never discovered wherein the art he practised
differed from that of a plumber, a glazier. He had not forgotten the shock he
once administered to her by letting her know that he wore an apron; she looked
down on such conditions from the summit of her own intellectual profession, for
<i>she</i> wore mantles and jackets and shawls, and the long trains of robes
exhibited in the window on dummies of wire and taken down to be transferred to
her own undulating person, and had never a scrap to do with making them up, but
just with talking about them and showing them off, and persuading people of
their beauty and cheapness. It had been a source of endless comfort to her, in
her arduous evolution, that she herself never worked with her &rsquo;ands.
Hyacinth answered her inquiries, as she had answered his own of old, by asking
her what those people owed to the son of a person who had brought murder and
mourning into their bright sublimities, and whether she thought he was very
highly recommended to them. His question made her reflect for a moment; after
which she returned, with the finest spirit, &ldquo;Well, if your position was
so miserable, ain&rsquo;t that all the more reason they should give you a lift?
Oh, it&rsquo;s something cruel!&rdquo; she cried; and she added that in his
place she would have found a way to bring herself under their notice.
<i>She</i> wouldn&rsquo;t have drudged out her life in Soho if she had had
gentlefolks&rsquo; blood in her veins! &ldquo;If they had noticed you they
would have liked you,&rdquo; she was so good as to observe; but she immediately
remembered, also, that in that case he would have been carried away quite over
her head. She was not prepared to say that she would have given him up, little
good as she had ever got of him. In that case he would have been thick with
real swells, and she emphasised the &lsquo;real&rsquo; by way of a thrust at
the fine lady of Madeira Crescent&mdash;an artifice which was wasted, however,
inasmuch as Hyacinth was sure she had extracted from Sholto a tolerably
detailed history of the personage in question. Millicent was tender and
tenderly sportive, and he was struck with the fact that his base birth really
made little impression upon her; she accounted it an accident much less grave
than he had been in the habit of doing. She was touched and moved; but what
moved her was his story of his mother&rsquo;s dreadful revenge, her long
imprisonment and his childish visit to the jail, with the later discovery of
his peculiar footing in the world. These things produced a generous
agitation&mdash;something the same in kind as the impressions she had
occasionally derived from the perusal of the <i>Family Herald</i>. What
affected her most, and what she came back to, was the whole element of Lord
Frederick and the misery of Hyacinth&rsquo;s having got so little good out of
his affiliation to that nobleman. She couldn&rsquo;t get over his friends not
having done something, though her imagination was still vague as to what they
might have done. It was the queerest thing in the world, to Hyacinth, to find
her apparently assuming that if he had not been so inefficient he might have
&lsquo;worked&rsquo; the whole dark episode as a source of distinction, of
glory. <i>She</i> wouldn&rsquo;t have been a nobleman&rsquo;s daughter for
nothing! Oh, the left hand was as good as the right; her respectability, for
the moment, didn&rsquo;t care for that! His long silence was what most
astonished her; it put her out of patience, and there was a strange candour in
her wonderment at his not having bragged about his grand relations. They had
become vivid and concrete to her now, in comparison with the timid shadows that
Pinnie had set into spasmodic circulation. Millicent bumped about in the hushed
past of her companion with the oddest mixture of sympathy and criticism, and
with good intentions which had the effect of profane voices holloaing for
echoes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me only&mdash;me and her? Certainly, I ought to be obliged, even though
it is late in the day. The first time you saw her I suppose you told
her&mdash;that night you went into her box at the theatre, eh? She&rsquo;d have
worse to tell you, I&rsquo;m sure, if she could ever bring herself to speak the
truth. And do you mean to say you never broke it to your big friend in the
chemical line?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, we have never talked about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Men are rare creatures!&rdquo; Millicent cried. &ldquo;You never so much
as mentioned it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t necessary. He knew it otherwise&mdash;he knew it through
his sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know that, if he never spoke?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, because he was jolly good to me,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose that ruined him,&rdquo; Miss Henning
rejoined. &ldquo;And how did his sister know it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; she guessed it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Millicent stared. &ldquo;It was none of her business.&rdquo; Then she added,
&ldquo;He <i>was</i> jolly good to you? Ain&rsquo;t he good to you now?&rdquo;
She asked this question in her loud, free voice, which rang through the bright
stillness of the place.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth delayed for a minute to answer her, and when at last he did so it was
without looking at her: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I can&rsquo;t make it
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can, then!&rdquo; And Millicent jerked him round toward her and
inspected him with her big bright eyes. &ldquo;You silly baby, has <i>he</i>
been serving you?&rdquo; She pressed her question upon him; she asked if that
was what disagreed with him. His lips gave her no answer, but apparently, after
an instant, she found one in his face. &ldquo;Has he been making up to her
ladyship&mdash;is that his game?&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;Do you mean to
say she&rsquo;d look at the likes of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The likes of him? He&rsquo;s as fine a man as stands!&rdquo; said
Hyacinth. &ldquo;They have the same views, they are doing the same work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he hasn&rsquo;t changed <i>his</i> opinions, then&mdash;not like
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he knows what he wants; he knows what he thinks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much the same work, I&rsquo;ll be bound!&rdquo; cried Millicent, in
large derision. &ldquo;He knows what he wants, and I dare say he&rsquo;ll get
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth got up, turning away from her; but she also rose, and passed her hand
into his arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their own business; they can do as they
please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t try to be a saint; you put me out of patience!&rdquo;
the girl responded, with characteristic energy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a precious
pair, and it would do me good to hear you say so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A man shouldn&rsquo;t turn against his friends,&rdquo; Hyacinth went on,
with desperate sententiousness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for them to remember; there&rsquo;s no danger of
<i>your</i> forgetting it.&rdquo; They had begun to walk, but she stopped him;
she was suddenly smiling at him, and her face was radiant. She went on, with
caressing inconsequence: &ldquo;All that you have told me&mdash;it <i>has</i>
made you nicer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that, but it has certainly made you so. My dear girl,
you&rsquo;re a comfort,&rdquo; Hyacinth added, as they strolled on again.

<h3><a name="chap42"></a>XLII</h3>

<p>
He had no intention of going in the evening to Madeira Crescent, and that is
why he asked his companion, before they separated, if he might not see her
again, after tea. The evenings were bitter to him now, and he feared them in
advance. The darkness had become a haunted element; it had visions for him that
passed even before his closed eyes&mdash;sharp doubts and fears and suspicions,
suggestions of evil, revelations of suffering. He wanted company, to light up
his gloom, and this had driven him back to Millicent, in a manner not
altogether consistent with the respect which it was still his theory that he
owed to his nobler part. He felt no longer free to drop in at the Crescent, and
tried to persuade himself, in case his mistrust should be overdone, that his
reasons were reasons of magnanimity. If Paul Muniment were seriously occupied
with the Princess, if they had work in hand for which their most earnest
attention was required (and Sunday was very likely to be the day they would
take: they had spent so much of the previous Sunday together), it would be
delicate on his part to stay away, to leave his friend a clear field. There was
something inexpressibly representative to him in the way that friend had
abruptly decided to re-enter the house, after pausing outside with its
mistress, at the moment he himself stood peering through the fog with the
Prince. The movement repeated itself innumerable times, to his moral
perception, suggesting to him things that he couldn&rsquo;t bear to learn.
Hyacinth was afraid of being jealous, even after he had become so, and to prove
to himself that he was not he had gone to see the Princess one evening in the
middle of the week. Hadn&rsquo;t he wanted Paul to know her, months and months
before, and now was he to entertain a vile feeling at the first manifestation
of an intimacy which rested, in each party to it, upon aspirations that he
respected? The Princess had not been at home, and he had turned away from the
door without asking for Madame Grandoni; he had not forgotten that on the
occasion of his previous visit she had excused herself from remaining in the
drawing-room. After the little maid in the Crescent had told him the Princess
was out he walked away with a quick curiosity&mdash;a curiosity which, if he
had listened to it, would have led him to mount upon the first omnibus that
travelled in the direction of Camberwell. Was Paul Muniment, who was such a
rare one, in general, for stopping at home of an evening&mdash;was he also out,
and would Rosy, in this case, be in the humour to mention (for of course she
would know) where he had gone? Hyacinth let the omnibus pass, for he suddenly
became aware, with a throb of horror, that he was in danger of playing the spy.
He had not been near Muniment since, on purpose to leave his curiosity
unsatisfied. He allowed himself however to notice that the Princess had now not
written him a word of consolation, as she had been so kind as to do once or
twice before when he had knocked at her door without finding her. At present he
had missed her twice in succession, and yet she had given no sign of
regret&mdash;regret even on his own behalf. This determined him to stay away
awhile longer; it was such a proof that she was absorbingly occupied.
Hyacinth&rsquo;s glimpse of the Princess in earnest conversation with Muniment
as they returned from the excursion described by the Prince, his memory of
Paul&rsquo;s relenting figure crossing the threshold once more, could leave him
no doubt as to the degree of that absorption.
</p>

<p>
Millicent hesitated when Hyacinth proposed to her that they should finish the
day together. She smiled, and her splendid eyes rested on his with an air of
indulgent interrogation; they seemed to ask whether it were worth her while, in
face of his probable incredulity, to mention the <i>real</i> reason why she
could not have the pleasure of acceding to his delightful suggestion. Since he
would be sure to deride her explanation, would not some trumped-up excuse do as
well, since he could knock that about without hurting her? I know not exactly
in what sense Miss Henning decided; but she confessed at last that there
<i>was</i> an odious obstacle to their meeting again later&mdash;a promise she
had made to go and see a young lady, the forewoman of her department, who was
kept in-doors with a bad face, and nothing in life to help her pass the time.
She was under a pledge to spend the evening with her, and it was not her way to
disappoint an expectation. Hyacinth made no comment on this speech; he received
it in silence, looking at the girl gloomily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s passing in your mind!&rdquo; Millicent suddenly
broke out. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say it at once, and give me a chance to
contradict it? I oughtn&rsquo;t to care, but I do care!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop&mdash;don&rsquo;t let us fight!&rdquo; Hyacinth spoke in a
tone of pleading weariness; she had never heard just that accent before.
</p>

<p>
Millicent considered a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to play her false. She
is a real lady, highly connected, and the best friend I have&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t count men,&rdquo; the girl interpolated, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;and
there isn&rsquo;t one in the world I&rsquo;d do such a thing for but
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, keep your promise; don&rsquo;t play any one false,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a gentleman!&rdquo; Miss Henning murmured, with a
sweetness that her voice occasionally took.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Especially&mdash;&rdquo; Hyacinth began; but he suddenly stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Especially what? Something impudent, I&rsquo;ll engage! Especially as
you don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no! Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s fight!&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fight, my darling? I&rsquo;d fight <i>for</i> you!&rdquo; Miss Henning
declared.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth offered himself, after tea, the choice between a visit to Lady Aurora
and a pilgrimage to Lisson Grove. He was in a little doubt about the former
experiment, having an idea that her ladyship&rsquo;s family might have returned
to Belgrave Square. He reflected, however, that he could not recognise that as
a reason for not going to see her; his relations with her were not clandestine,
and she had given him the kindest general invitation. If her august progenitors
were at home she was probably at dinner with them; he would take that risk. He
had taken it before, without disastrous results. He was determined not to spend
the evening alone, and he would keep the Poupins as a more substantial
alternative, in case her ladyship should not be able to receive him.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the great portal in Belgrave Square was drawn open before him, he
perceived that the house was occupied and animated&mdash;if the latter term
might properly be applied to a place which had hitherto given Hyacinth the
impression of a magnificent mausoleum. It was pervaded by subdued light and
tall domestics; Hyacinth found himself looking down a kind of colonnade of
colossal footmen, an array more imposing even than the retinue of the Princess
at Medley. His inquiry died away on his lips, and he stood there struggling
with dumbness. It was manifest to him that some high festival was taking place,
at which his presence could only be deeply irrelevant; and when a large
official, out of livery, bending over him for a voice that faltered, suggested,
not unencouragingly, that it might be Lady Aurora he wished to see, he replied
in a low, melancholy accent, &ldquo;Yes, yes, but it can&rsquo;t be
possible!&rdquo; The butler took no pains to controvert this proposition
verbally; he merely turned round, with a majestic air of leading the way, and
as at the same moment two of the footmen closed the wings of the door behind
the visitor, Hyacinth judged that it was his cue to follow him. In this manner,
after traversing a passage where, in the perfect silence of the servants, he
heard the shorter click of his plebeian shoes upon a marble floor, he found
himself ushered into a small apartment, lighted by a veiled lamp, which, when
he had been left there alone, without further remark on the part of his
conductor, he recognised as the scene&mdash;only now more amply
decorated&mdash;of one of his former interviews. Lady Aurora kept him waiting a
few moments, and then fluttered in with an anxious, incoherent apology. The
same transformation had taken place in her own appearance as in the aspect of
her parental halls: she had on a light-coloured, crumpled-looking,
faintly-rustling dress; her head was adorned with a kind of languid plume,
terminating in little pink tips; and in her hand she carried a pair of white
gloves. All her repressed eagerness was in her face, and she smiled as if she
wished to anticipate any scruples or embarrassments on the part of her visitor;
frankly recognising the brilliancy of her attire and the startling implications
it might convey. Hyacinth said to her that, no doubt, on perceiving her family
had returned to town, he ought to have backed out; he knew that must make a
difference in her life. But he had been marched in, in spite of himself, and
now it was clear that he had interrupted her at dinner. She answered that no
one who asked for her at any hour was ever turned away; she had managed to
arrange that, and she was very happy in her success. She didn&rsquo;t usually
dine&mdash;there were so many of them, and it took so long. Most of her friends
couldn&rsquo;t come at visiting-hours, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be right that she
shouldn&rsquo;t ever receive them. On that occasion she <i>had</i> been dining,
but it was all over; she was only sitting there because she was going to a
party. Her parents were dining out, and she was just in the drawing-room with
some of her sisters. When they were alone it wasn&rsquo;t so long, though it
was rather long afterwards, when they went up again. It wasn&rsquo;t time yet:
the carriage wouldn&rsquo;t come for nearly half an hour. She hadn&rsquo;t been
to an evening thing for months and months, but&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he
know?&mdash;one sometimes had to do it. Lady Aurora expressed the idea that one
ought to be fair all round and that one&rsquo;s duties were not all of the same
species; some of them would come up from time to time that were quite different
from the others. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t just, unless one did all, and that
was why she was in for something to-night. It was nothing of consequence; only
the family meeting the family, as they might do of a Sunday, at one of their
houses. It was there that papa and mamma were dining. Since they had given her
that room for any hour she wanted (it was really tremendously convenient), she
had determined to do a party now and then, like a respectable young woman,
because it pleased them&mdash;though why it should, to see <i>her</i> at a
place, was more than she could imagine. She supposed it was because it would
perhaps keep some people, a little, from thinking she was mad and not safe to
be at large&mdash;which was of course a sort of thing that people didn&rsquo;t
like to have thought of their belongings. Lady Aurora explained and expatiated
with a kind of nervous superabundance; she talked more continuously than
Hyacinth had ever heard her do before, and the young man saw that she was not
in her natural equilibrium. He thought it scarcely probable that she was
excited by the simple prospect of again dipping into the great world she had
forsworn, and he presently perceived that he himself had an agitating effect
upon her. His senses were fine enough to make him feel that he revived certain
associations and quickened certain wounds. She suddenly stopped talking, and
the two sat there looking at each other, in a kind of occult community of
suffering. Hyacinth made several mechanical remarks, explaining,
insufficiently, why he had come, and in the course of a very few moments, quite
independently of these observations, it seemed to him that there was a deeper,
a measurelessly deep, confidence between them. A tacit confession passed and
repassed, and each understood the situation of the other. They wouldn&rsquo;t
speak of it&mdash;it was very definite that they would never do that; for there
was something in their common consciousness that was inconsistent with the
grossness of accusation. Besides, the grievance of each was an apprehension, an
instinct of the soul&mdash;not a sharp, definite wrong, supported by proof. It
was in the air and in their restless pulses, and not in anything that they
could exhibit or complain of. Strange enough it seemed to Hyacinth that the
history of each should be the counterpart of that of the other. What had each
done but lose that which he or she had never had? Things had gone ill with
them; but even if they had gone well, if the Princess had not combined with his
friend in that manner which made his heart sink and produced an effect exactly
corresponding upon that of Lady Aurora&mdash;even in this case what would
prosperity, what would success, have amounted to? They would have been very
barren. He was sure the singular creature before him would never have had a
chance to take the unprecedented social step for the sake of which she was
ready to go forth from Belgrave Square for ever; Hyacinth had judged the
smallness of Paul Muniment&rsquo;s appetite for that complication sufficiently
to have begun really to pity her ladyship long ago. And now, even when he most
felt the sweetness of her sympathy, he might wonder what she could have
imagined for him in the event of his not having been supplanted&mdash;what
security, what completer promotion, what honourable, satisfying sequel. They
were unhappy because they were unhappy, and they were right not to rail about
that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I like to see you&mdash;I like to talk with you,&rdquo; said Lady
Aurora, simply. They talked for a quarter of an hour, and he made her such a
visit as any gentleman might have made to any lady. They exchanged remarks
about the lateness of the spring, about the loan-exhibition at Burlington
House&mdash;which Hyacinth had paid his shilling to see&mdash;about the
question of opening the museums on Sunday, about the danger of too much
coddling legislation on behalf of the working-classes. He declared that it gave
him great pleasure to see any sign of her amusing herself; it was unnatural
never to do that, and he hoped that now she had taken a turn she would keep it
up. At this she looked down, smiling, at her frugal finery, and then she
replied, &ldquo;I dare say I shall begin to go to balls&mdash;who knows?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what our friends in Audley Court think, you know&mdash;that
it&rsquo;s the worst mistake you can make, not to drink deep of the cup while
you have it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll do it, then&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do it for them!&rdquo; Lady
Aurora exclaimed. &ldquo;I dare say that, as regards all that, I haven&rsquo;t
listened to them enough.&rdquo; This was the only allusion that passed on the
subject of the Muniments.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth got up&mdash;he had stayed long enough, as she was going out; and as
he held out his hand to her she seemed to him a heroine. She would try to
cultivate the pleasures of her class if the brother and sister in Camberwell
thought it right&mdash;try even to be a woman of fashion in order to console
herself. Paul Muniment didn&rsquo;t care for her, but she was capable of
considering that it might be her duty to regulate her life by the very advice
that made an abyss between them. Hyacinth didn&rsquo;t believe in the success
of this attempt; there passed before his imagination a picture of the poor lady
coming home and pulling off her feathers for ever, after an evening spent in
watching the agitation of a ball-room from the outer edge of the circle, with a
white, irresponsive face. &ldquo;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
die,&rdquo; he said, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind dying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; Hyacinth declared, as he turned away. There had
been no mention whatever of the Princess.
</p>

<p>
It was early enough in the evening for him to risk a visit to Lisson Grove; he
calculated that the Poupins would still be sitting up. When he reached their
house he found this calculation justified; the brilliancy of the light in the
window appeared to announce that Madame was holding a salon. He ascended to
this apartment without delay (it was free to a visitor to open the house-door
himself), and, having knocked, obeyed the hostess&rsquo;s invitation to enter.
Poupin and his wife were seated, with a third person, at a table in the middle
of the room, round a staring kerosene lamp adorned with a globe of clear glass,
of which the transparency was mitigated only by a circular pattern of bunches
of grapes. The third person was his friend Schinkel, who had been a member of
the little party that waited upon Hoffendahl. No one said anything as Hyacinth
came in; but in their silence the three others got up, looking at him, as he
thought, rather strangely.
</p>

<h3><a name="chap43"></a>XLIII</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;My child, you are always welcome,&rdquo; said Eustache Poupin, taking
Hyacinth&rsquo;s hand in both his own and holding it for some moments. An
impression had come to our young man, immediately, that they were talking about
him before he appeared and that they would rather have been left to talk at
their ease. He even thought he saw in Poupin&rsquo;s face the kind of
consciousness that comes from detection, or at least interruption, in a
nefarious act. With Poupin, however, it was difficult to tell; he always looked
so heated and exalted, so like a conspirator defying the approach of justice.
Hyacinth contemplated the others: they were standing as if they had shuffled
something on the table out of sight, as if they had been engaged in the
manufacture of counterfeit coin. Poupin kept hold of his hand; the
Frenchman&rsquo;s ardent eyes, fixed, unwinking, always expressive of the
greatness of the occasion, whatever the occasion was, had never seemed to him
to protrude so far from his head. &ldquo;Ah, my dear friend, <i>nous causions
justement de vous</i>,&rdquo; Eustache remarked, as if this were a very
extraordinary fact.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>nous causions&mdash;nous causions!</i>&rdquo; his wife exclaimed,
as if to deprecate an indiscreet exaggeration. &ldquo;One may mention a friend,
I suppose, in the way of conversation, without taking such a liberty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A cat may look at a king, as your English proverb says,&rdquo; added
Schinkel, jocosely. He smiled so hard at his own pleasantry that his eyes
closed up and vanished&mdash;an effect which Hyacinth, who had observed it
before, thought particularly unbecoming to him, appearing as it did to
administer the last perfection to his ugliness. He would have consulted his
interests by cultivating immobility of feature.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, a king, a king!&rdquo; murmured Poupin, shaking his head up and
down. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s not good to be, <i>au point où nous
en sommes</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just came in to wish you good-night,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s rather late for a call, though Schinkel is
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always too late, my very dear, when you come,&rdquo; the
Frenchman rejoined. &ldquo;You know if you have a place at our fireside.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I esteem it too much to disturb it,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling and
looking round at the three.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can easily sit down again; we are a comfortable party. Put yourself
beside me.&rdquo; And the Frenchman drew a chair close to the one, at the
table, that he had just quitted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has had a long walk, he is tired&mdash;he will certainly accept a
little glass,&rdquo; Madame Poupin announced with decision, moving toward the
tray containing the small gilded <i>liqueur</i> service.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will each accept one, <i>ma bonne;</i> it is a very good occasion for
a drop of <i>fine</i>,&rdquo; her husband interposed, while Hyacinth seated
himself in the chair his host had designated. Schinkel resumed his place, which
was opposite; he looked across at Hyacinth without speaking, but his long face
continued to flatten itself into a representation of mirth. He had on a green
coat, which Hyacinth had seen before; it was a garment of ceremony, such as our
young man judged it would have been impossible to procure in London or in any
modern time. It was eminently German and of high antiquity, and had a tall,
stiff, clumsy collar, which came up to the wearer&rsquo;s ears and almost
concealed his perpetual bandage. When Hyacinth had sat down Eustache Poupin did
not take possession of his own chair, but stood beside him, resting his hand on
his head. At that touch something came over Hyacinth, and his heart sprang into
his throat. The idea that occurred to him, conveyed in Poupin&rsquo;s whole
manner as well as in the reassuring intention of that caress and in his
wife&rsquo;s uneasy, instant offer of refreshment, explained the embarrassment
of the circle and reminded our young man of the engagement he had taken with
himself to exhibit an extraordinary quietness when a certain crisis in his life
should have arrived. It seemed to him that this crisis was in the air, very
near&mdash;that he should touch it if he made another movement; the pressure of
the Frenchman&rsquo;s hand, which was meant as a solvent, only operated as a
warning. As he looked across at Schinkel he felt dizzy and a little sick; for a
moment, to his senses, the room whirled round. His resolution to be quiet
appeared only too easy to keep; he couldn&rsquo;t break it even to the extent
of speaking. He knew that his voice would tremble, and that is why he made no
answer to Schinkel&rsquo;s rather honeyed words, uttered after an hesitation:
&ldquo;<i>Also</i>, my dear Robinson, have you passed your Sunday
well&mdash;have you had an &rsquo;appy day?&rdquo; Why was every one so
endearing? His eyes questioned the table, but encountered nothing but its
well-wiped surface, polished for so many years by the gustatory elbows of the
Frenchman and his wife, and the lady&rsquo;s dirty pack of cards for
&lsquo;patience&rsquo; (she had apparently been engaged in this exercise when
Schinkel came in), which indeed gave a little the impression of gamblers
surprised, who might have shuffled away the stakes. Madame Poupin, who had
dived into a cupboard, came back with a bottle of green chartreuse, an
apparition which led the German to exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Lieber Gott</i>, you
Vrench, you Vrench, how well you manage! What would you have more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hostess distributed the liquor, but Hyacinth was scarcely able to swallow
it, though it was highly appreciated by his companions. His indifference to
this luxury excited much discussion and conjecture, the others bandying
theories and contradictions, and even ineffectual jokes, about him, over his
head, with a volubility which seemed to him unnatural. Poupin and Schinkel
professed the belief that there must be something very curious the matter with
a man who couldn&rsquo;t smack his lips over a drop of that tap; he must either
be in love or have some still more insidious complaint. It was true that
Hyacinth was always in love&mdash;that was no secret to his friends&mdash;and
it had never been observed to stop his thirst. The Frenchwoman poured scorn on
this view of the case, declaring that the effect of the tender passion was to
make one enjoy one&rsquo;s victual (when everything went straight, <i>bien
entendu;</i> and how could an ear be deaf to the whisperings of such a dear
little <i>bonhomme</i> as Hyacinth?), in proof of which she deposed that she
had never eaten and drunk with such relish as at the time&mdash;oh, it was far
away now&mdash;when she had a soft spot in her heart for her rascal of a
husband. For Madame Poupin to allude to her husband as a rascal indicated a
high degree of conviviality. Hyacinth sat staring at the empty table with the
feeling that he was, somehow, a detached, irresponsible witness of the
evolution of his fate. Finally he looked up and said to his friends,
collectively, &ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter with you all?&rdquo; And
he followed this inquiry by an invitation that they should tell him what it was
they had been saying about him, since they admitted that he had been the
subject of their conversation. Madame Poupin answered for them that they had
simply been saying how much they loved him, but that they wouldn&rsquo;t love
him any more if he became suspicious and <i>grincheux</i>. She had been telling
Mr Schinkel&rsquo;s fortune on the cards, and she would tell Hyacinth&rsquo;s
if he liked. There was nothing much for Mr Schinkel, only that he would find
something, some day, that he had lost, but would probably lose it again, and
serve him right if he did! He objected that he had never had anything to lose,
and never expected to have; but that was a vain remark, inasmuch as the time
was fast coming when every one would have something&mdash;though indeed it was
to be hoped that he would keep it when he had got it. Eustache rebuked his wife
for her levity, reminded her that their young friend cared nothing for old
women&rsquo;s tricks, and said he was sure Hyacinth had come to talk over a
very different matter&mdash;the question (he was so good as to take an interest
in it, as he had done in everything that related to them) of the terms which M.
Poupin might owe it to himself, to his dignity, to a just though not
exaggerated sentiment of his value, to make in accepting Mr Crookenden&rsquo;s
offer of the foremanship of the establishment in Soho; an offer not yet
formally enunciated but visibly in the air and destined&mdash;it would seem, at
least&mdash;to arrive within a day or two. The old foreman was going to set up
for himself. The Frenchman intimated that before accepting any such proposal he
must have the most substantial guarantees. &ldquo;<i>Il me faudrait des
conditions très-particulières</i>.&rdquo; It was singular to Hyacinth to hear
M. Poupin talk so comfortably about these high contingencies, the chasm by
which he himself was divided from the future having suddenly doubled its width.
His host and hostess sat down on either side of him, and Poupin gave a sketch,
in somewhat sombre tints, of the situation in Soho, enumerating certain
elements of decomposition which he perceived to be at work there and which he
would not undertake to deal with unless he should be given a completely free
hand. Did Schinkel understand, and was that what Schinkel was grinning at? Did
Schinkel understand that poor Eustache was the victim of an absurd
hallucination and that there was not the smallest chance of his being invited
to assume a lieutenancy? He had less capacity for tackling the British workman
to-day than when he began to rub shoulders with him, and Mr Crookenden had
never in his life made a mistake, at least in the use of his tools.
Hyacinth&rsquo;s responses were few and mechanical, and he presently ceased to
try to look as if he were entering into the Frenchman&rsquo;s ideas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have some news&mdash;you have some news about me,&rdquo; he
remarked, abruptly, to Schinkel. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it, you
don&rsquo;t like to have to give it to me, and you came to ask our friends here
whether they wouldn&rsquo;t help you out with it. But I don&rsquo;t think they
will assist you particularly, poor dears! Why do you mind? You oughtn&rsquo;t
to mind more than I do. That isn&rsquo;t the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce qu&rsquo;il dit&mdash;qu&rsquo;est-ce qu&rsquo;il
dit, le pauvre chéri?</i>&rdquo; Madame Poupin demanded, eagerly; while
Schinkel looked very hard at her husband, as if to ask for direction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear child, <i>vous vous faites des idées!</i>&rdquo; the latter
exclaimed, laying his hand on him remonstrantly.
</p>

<p>
But Hyacinth pushed away his chair and got up. &ldquo;If you have anything to
tell me, it is cruel of you to let me see it, as you have done, and yet not to
satisfy me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I have anything to tell you?&rdquo; Schinkel asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, but I believe you have. I perceive things, I
guess things, quickly. That&rsquo;s my nature at all times, and I do it much
more now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do it indeed; it is very wonderful,&rdquo; said Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Schinkel, will you do me the pleasure to go away&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
care where&mdash;out of this house?&rdquo; Madame Poupin broke out, in French.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that will be the best thing, and I will go with you,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you would retire, my child, I think it would be a service that you
would render us,&rdquo; Poupin returned, appealing to his young friend.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you do us the justice to believe that you may leave your
interests in our hands?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment; it was now perfectly clear to him that Schinkel
had some sort of message for him, and his curiosity as to what it might be had
become nearly intolerable. &ldquo;I am surprised at your weakness,&rdquo; he
observed, as sternly as he could manage it, to Poupin.
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman stared at him an instant, and then fell on his neck. &ldquo;You
are sublime, my young friend&mdash;you are sublime!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you be so good as to tell me what you are going to do with that
young man?&rdquo; demanded Madame Poupin, glaring at Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business, my poor lady,&rdquo; Hyacinth replied,
disengaging himself from her husband. &ldquo;Schinkel, I wish you would walk
away with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Calmons-nous, entendons-nous, expliquons-nous!</i> The situation is
very simple,&rdquo; Poupin went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, if it will give you pleasure,&rdquo; said Schinkel,
very obligingly, to Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you will give me that letter first!&rdquo; Madame Poupin, erecting
herself, declared to the German.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My wife, you are an imbecile!&rdquo; Poupin groaned, lifting his hands
and shoulders and turning away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I may be an imbecile, but I won&rsquo;t be a party&mdash;no, God help
me, not to that!&rdquo; protested the Frenchwoman, planted before Schinkel as
if to prevent his moving.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you have a letter for me, you ought to give it to me,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth to Schinkel. &ldquo;You have no right to give it to any one
else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will bring it to you in your house, my good friend,&rdquo; Schinkel
replied, with a little wink that seemed to say that Madame Poupin would have to
be considered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, in his house&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go to his house!&rdquo; cried the
lady. &ldquo;I regard you, I have always regarded you, as my child,&rdquo; she
declared to Hyacinth, &ldquo;and if this isn&rsquo;t an occasion for a
mother!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that are making it an occasion. I don&rsquo;t know what
you are talking about,&rdquo; said Hyacinth. He had been questioning
Schinkel&rsquo;s eye, and he thought he saw there a little twinkle of assurance
that he might really depend upon him. &ldquo;I have disturbed you, and I think
I had better go away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poupin had turned round again; he seized the young man&rsquo;s arm eagerly, as
if to prevent his retiring before he had given a certain satisfaction.
&ldquo;How can you care, when you know everything is changed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;everything is changed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your opinions, your sympathies, your whole attitude. I don&rsquo;t
approve of it&mdash;<i>je le constate</i>. You have withdrawn your confidence
from the people; you have said things in this spot, where you stand now, that
have given pain to my wife and me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t love you, we should say that you had betrayed
us!&rdquo; cried Madame Poupin, quickly, taking her husband&rsquo;s idea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I shall never betray you,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will never betray us&mdash;of course you think so. But you have no
right to act for the people when you have ceased to believe in the people.
<i>Il faut être conséquent, nom de Dieu!</i>&rdquo; Poupin went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will give up all thoughts of acting for me&mdash;<i>je ne permets
pas ça!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed his wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is probably not of importance&mdash;only a little fraternal
greeting,&rdquo; Schinkel suggested, soothingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We repudiate you, we deny you, we denounce you!&rdquo; shouted Poupin,
more and more excited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor friends, it is you who have broken down, not I,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth. &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for your solicitude, but the
inconsequence is yours. At all events, good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned away from them, and was leaving the room, when Madame Poupin threw
herself upon him, as her husband had done a moment before, but in silence and
with an extraordinary force of passion and distress. Being stout and powerful
she quickly got the better of him, and pressed him to her ample bosom in a
long, dumb embrace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you want me to do,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, as soon
as he could speak. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for me to judge of my convictions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We want you to do nothing, because we <i>know</i> you have
changed,&rdquo; Poupin replied. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it stick out of you, in
every glance of your eye and every breath of your lips? It&rsquo;s only for
that, because that alters everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does it alter my engagement? There are some things in which one
can&rsquo;t change. I didn&rsquo;t promise to believe; I promised to
obey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We want you to be sincere&mdash;that is the great thing,&rdquo; said
Poupin, edifyingly. &ldquo;I will go to see them&mdash;I will make them
understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you should have done that before!&rdquo; Madame Poupin groaned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whom you are talking about, but I will allow no one
to meddle in my affairs.&rdquo; Hyacinth spoke with sudden vehemence; the scene
was cruel to his nerves, which were not in a condition to bear it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When it is Hoffendahl, it is no good to meddle,&rdquo; Schinkel
remarked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray, who is Hoffendahl, and what authority has he got?&rdquo;
demanded Madame Poupin, who had caught his meaning. &ldquo;Who has put him over
us all, and is there nothing to do but to lie down in the dust before him? Let
him attend to his little affairs himself, and not put them off on innocent
children, no matter whether they are with us or against us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This protest went so far that, evidently, Poupin felt a little ashamed of his
wife. &ldquo;He has no authority but what we give him; but you know that we
respect him, that he is one of the pure, <i>ma bonne</i>. Hyacinth can do
exactly as he likes; he knows that as well as we do. He knows there is not a
feather&rsquo;s weight of compulsion; he knows that, for my part, I long since
ceased to expect anything from him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, there is no compulsion,&rdquo; said Schinkel.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to take or to leave. Only <i>they</i> keep the books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth stood there before the three, with his eyes on the floor. &ldquo;Of
course I can do as I like, and what I like is what I <i>shall</i> do. Besides,
what are we talking about, with such sudden passion?&rdquo; he asked, looking
up. &ldquo;I have no summons, I have no sign. When the call reaches me, it will
be time to discuss it. Let it come or not come: it&rsquo;s not my
affair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, it is not your affair,&rdquo; said Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why M. Paul has never done anything, all this time,
knowing that everything is different now!&rdquo; Madame Poupin exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my dear boy, I don&rsquo;t understand our friend,&rdquo; her
husband remarked, watching Hyacinth with suspicious, contentious eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of his business, any more than ours; it&rsquo;s none of
any one&rsquo;s business!&rdquo; Schinkel declared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Muniment walks straight; the best thing you can do is to imitate
him,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, trying to pass Poupin, who had placed himself before
the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promise me only this&mdash;not to do anything till I have seen you
first,&rdquo; the Frenchman begged, almost piteously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor old friend, you are very weak.&rdquo; And Hyacinth opened the
door, in spite of him, and passed out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well, if you <i>are</i> with us, that&rsquo;s all I want to
know!&rdquo; the young man heard him say, behind him, at the top of the stairs,
in a different voice, a tone of sudden, exaggerated fortitude.
</p>

<h3><a name="chap44"></a>XLIV</h3>

<p>
Hyacinth hurried down and got out of the house, but he had not the least
intention of losing sight of Schinkel. The odd behaviour of the Poupins was a
surprise and annoyance, and he had wished to shake himself free from it. He was
candidly astonished at the alarm they were so good as to feel for him, for he
had never perceived that they had gone round to the hope that the note he had
signed (as it were) to Hoffendahl would not be presented. What had he said,
what had he done, after all, to give them the right to fasten on him the charge
of apostasy? He had always been a free critic of everything, and it was natural
that, on certain occasions, in the little parlour in Lisson Grove, he should
have spoken in accordance with that freedom; but it was only with the Princess
that he had permitted himself really to rail at the democracy and given the
full measure of his scepticism. He would have thought it indelicate to express
contempt for the opinions of his old foreign friends, to whom associations that
made them venerable were attached; and, moreover, for Hyacinth, a change of
heart was, in the nature of things, much more an occasion for a hush of
publicity and a kind of retrospective reserve; it couldn&rsquo;t prompt one to
aggression or jubilation. When one had but lately discovered what could be said
on the opposite side one didn&rsquo;t want to boast of one&rsquo;s
sharpness&mdash;not even when one&rsquo;s new convictions cast shadows that
looked like the ghosts of the old.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth lingered in the street, a certain distance from the house, watching
for Schinkel&rsquo;s exit and prepared to remain there if necessary till the
dawn of another day. He had said to his friends, just before, that the manner
in which the communication they looked so askance at should reach him was none
of his business&mdash;it might reach him as it could. This was true enough in
theory, but in fact his desire was overwhelming to know what Madame Poupin had
meant by her allusion to a letter, destined for him, in Schinkel&rsquo;s
possession&mdash;an allusion confirmed by Schinkel&rsquo;s own virtual
acknowledgment. It was indeed this eagerness that had driven him out of the
house, for he had reason to believe that the German would not fail him, and it
galled his suspense to see the foolish Poupins try to interpose, to divert the
missive from its course. He waited and waited, in the faith that Schinkel was
dealing with them in his slow, categorical Teutonic way, and only objurgated
the cabinet-maker for having in the first place paltered with his sacred trust.
Why hadn&rsquo;t he come straight to him&mdash;whatever the mysterious document
was&mdash;instead of talking it over with French featherheads? Passers were
rare, at this hour, in Lisson Grove, and lights were mainly extinguished; there
was nothing to look at but the vista of the low black houses, the dim,
interspaced street-lamps, the prowling cats who darted occasionally across the
road, and the terrible, mysterious, far-off stars, which appeared to him more
than ever to see everything and to tell nothing. A policeman creaked along on
the opposite side of the way, looking across at him as he passed, and stood for
some minutes on the corner, as if to keep an eye on him. Hyacinth had leisure
to reflect that the day was perhaps not far off when a policeman might have his
eye on him for a very good reason&mdash;might walk up and down, pass and
repass, as he mounted guard over him.
</p>

<p>
It seemed horribly long before Schinkel came out of the house, but it was
probably only half an hour. In the stillness of the street he heard Poupin let
his visitor out, and at the sound he stepped back into the recess of a doorway
on the same side, so that, in looking out, the Frenchman should not see him
waiting. There was another delay, for the two stood talking together
interminably and in a low tone on the doorstep. At last, however, Poupin went
in again, and then Schinkel came down the street towards Hyacinth, who had
calculated that he would proceed in that direction, it being, as Hyacinth
happened to know, that of his own lodging. After he had heard Poupin go in he
stopped and looked up and down; it was evidently his idea that Hyacinth would
be waiting for him. Our hero stepped out of the shallow recess in which he had
been flattening himself, and came straight to him, and the two men stood there
face to face, in the dusky, empty, sordid street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let them have the letter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I retained it,&rdquo; said Schinkel, with his eyes more than ever
like invisible points.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then hadn&rsquo;t you better give it to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will talk of that&mdash;we will talk.&rdquo; Schinkel made no motion
to satisfy his friend; he had his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and his
appearance was characterised by an exasperating assumption that they had the
whole night before them. He was intolerably methodical.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should we talk? Haven&rsquo;t you talked enough with those people,
all the evening? What have they to say about it? What right have you to detain
a letter that belongs to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Erlauben Sie</i>: I will light my pipe,&rdquo; the German remarked.
And he proceeded to this business, methodically, while Hyacinth&rsquo;s pale,
excited face showed in the glow of the match that he ignited on the rusty
railing beside them. &ldquo;It is not yours unless I have given it to
you,&rdquo; Schinkel went on, as they walked along. &ldquo;Be patient, and I
will tell you,&rdquo; he added, passing his hand into his companion&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;Your way, not so? We will go down toward the Park.&rdquo; Hyacinth
tried to be patient, and he listened with interest when Schinkel said,
&ldquo;She tried to take it; she attacked me with her hands. But that was not
what I went for, to give it up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she mad? I don&rsquo;t recognise them,&rdquo; Hyacinth murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but they lofe you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, then, do they try to disgrace me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They think it is no disgrace, if you have changed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very well for her; but it&rsquo;s pitiful for him, and I
declare it surprises me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he came round, and he helped me to resist. He pulled his wife off.
It was the first shock,&rdquo; said Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to have shocked them, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Hyacinth
replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was shocked myself&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, how shaky you all are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You take it well. I am very sorry. But it is a fine chance,&rdquo;
Schinkel went on, smoking away. His pipe, for the moment, seemed to absorb him,
so that after a silence Hyacinth resumed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be so good as to reflect that all this while I don&rsquo;t in the least
understand what you are talking about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it was this morning, early,&rdquo; said the German. &ldquo;You
know in my country we don&rsquo;t lie in bed late, and what they do in my
country I try to do everywhere. I think it is good enough. In winter I get up,
of course, long before the sun, and in summer I get up almost at the same time.
I should see the fine spectacle of the sunrise, if in London you could see. The
first thing I do of a Sunday is to smoke a pipe at my window, which is at the
front, you remember, and looks into a little dirty street. At that hour there
is nothing to see there&mdash;you English are so slow to leave the bed. Not
much, however, at any time; it is not important, my little street. But my first
pipe is the one I enjoy most. I want nothing else when I have that pleasure. I
look out at the new, fresh light&mdash;though in London it is not very
fresh&mdash;and I think it is the beginning of another day. I wonder what such
a day will bring; whether it will bring anything good to us poor devils. But I
have seen a great many pass, and nothing has come. This morning, however,
brought something&mdash;something, at least, to you. On the other side of the
way I saw a young man, who stood just opposite to my house, looking up at my
window. He looked at me straight, without any ceremony, and I smoked my pipe
and looked at him. I wondered what he wanted, but he made no sign and spoke no
word. He was a very nice young man; he had an umbrella, and he wore spectacles.
We remained that way, face to face, perhaps for a quarter of an hour, and at
last he took out his watch&mdash;he had a watch, too&mdash;and held it in his
hand, just glancing at it every few minutes, as if to let me know that he would
rather not give me the whole day. Then it came over me that he wanted to speak
to me! You would have guessed that before, but we good Germans are slow. When
we understand, however, we act; so I nodded to him, to let him know I would
come down. I put on my coat and my shoes, for I was only in my shirt and
stockings (though of course I had on my trousers), and I went down into the
street. When he saw me come he walked slowly away, but at the end of a little
distance he waited for me. When I came near him I saw that he was a very nice
young man indeed&mdash;very young, with a very pleasant, friendly face. He was
also very neat, and he had gloves, and his umbrella was of silk. I liked him
very much. He said I should come round the corner, so we went round the corner
together. I thought there would be some one there waiting for us; but there was
nothing&mdash;only the closed shops and the early light and a little spring
mist which told that the day would be fine. I didn&rsquo;t know what he wanted;
perhaps it was some of our business&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I first
thought&mdash;and perhaps it was only a little game. So I was very careful; I
didn&rsquo;t ask him to come into the house. Yet I told him that he must excuse
me for not understanding more quickly that he wished to speak with me; and when
I said that, he said it was not of consequence&mdash;he would have waited
there, for the chance to see me all day. I told him I was glad I had spared him
that, at least, and we had some very polite conversation. He <i>was</i> a very
nice young man. But what he wanted was simply to put a letter in my hand; as he
said himself, he was only a kind of private postman. He gave me the
letter&mdash;it was not addressed; and when I had taken it I asked him how he
knew, and if he wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry if it should turn out that I was not
the man for whom the letter was meant. But I didn&rsquo;t give him a start; he
told me he knew all it was necessary for him to know&mdash;he knew exactly what
to do and how to do it. I think he is a valuable member. I asked him if the
letter required an answer, and he told me he had nothing to do with that; he
was only to put it in my hand. He recommended me to wait till I had gone into
the house again to read it. We had a little more talk&mdash;always very polite;
and he mentioned that he had come so early because he thought I might go out,
if he delayed, and because, also, he had a great deal to do and had to take his
time when he could. It is true that he looked as if he had plenty to
do&mdash;as if he was in some very good occupation. I should tell you that he
spoke to me always in English, but he is not English; he sounded his words like
some kind of foreigner. I suppose he is not German, or he would have spoken to
me in German. But there are so many, of all countries! I said if he had so much
to do I wouldn&rsquo;t keep him; I would go to my room and open my letter. He
said it wasn&rsquo;t important; and then I asked him if he wouldn&rsquo;t come
into my room, also, and rest. I told him it wasn&rsquo;t very handsome, my
room&mdash;because he looked like a young man who would have, for himself, a
very neat lodging. Then I found he meant it wasn&rsquo;t important that we
should talk any more, and he went away without even offering to shake hands. I
don&rsquo;t know if he had other letters to give, but he went away, as I have
said, like a postman on his rounds, without giving me any more
information.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It took Schinkel a long time to unfold this story&mdash;his calm and
conscientious thoroughness made no allowance for any painful acuteness of
curiosity that Hyacinth might feel. He went from step to step, and treated his
different points with friendly explicitness, as if each would have exactly the
same interest for his companion. The latter made no attempt to hurry him, and
indeed he listened, now, with a kind of intense patience; for he <i>was</i>
interested, and, moreover, it was clear to him that he was safe with Schinkel;
the German would satisfy him in time&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t worry him with
attaching conditions to their transaction, in spite of the mistake he had made
in going for guidance to Lisson Grove. Hyacinth learned in due course that on
returning to his apartment and opening the little packet of which he had been
put into possession, Mr Schinkel had found himself confronted with two separate
articles: one a sealed letter superscribed with our young man&rsquo;s name, the
other a sheet of paper containing in three lines a request that within two days
of receiving it he would hand the letter to the &lsquo;young Robinson&rsquo;.
The three lines in question were signed D. H., and the letter was addressed in
the same hand. Schinkel professed that he already knew the writing; it was that
of Diedrich Hoffendahl. &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; he said, exerting a soothing
pressure upon Hyacinth&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I will walk with you to your door,
and I will give it to you there; unless you like better that I should keep it
till to-morrow morning, so that you may have a quiet sleep&mdash;I mean in case
it might contain anything that will be disagreeable to you. But it is probably
nothing; it is probably only a word to say that you need think no more about
your engagement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should it be that?&rdquo; Hyacinth asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Probably he has heard that you repent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I repent?&rdquo; Hyacinth stopped him short; they had just reached
the top of Park Lane. &ldquo;To whom have I given a right to say that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah well, if you haven&rsquo;t, so much the better. It may be, then, for
some other reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot, Schinkel,&rdquo; Hyacinth returned, as they
walked along. And in a moment he went on, &ldquo;What the devil did you go and
tattle to the Poupins for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I thought they would like to know. Besides, I felt my
responsibility; I thought I should carry it better if they knew it. And then,
I&rsquo;m like them&mdash;I lofe you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth made no answer to this profession; he asked the next instant,
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your young man bring the letter directly to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I didn&rsquo;t ask him that! The reason was probably not
complicated, but simple&mdash;that those who wrote it knew my address and
didn&rsquo;t know yours. And wasn&rsquo;t I one of your guarantors?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but not the principal one. The principal one was Muniment. Why was
the letter not sent to me through him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Robinson, you want to know too many things. Depend upon it,
there are always good reasons. I should have liked it better if it had been
Muniment. But if they didn&rsquo;t send to him&mdash;&rdquo; Schinkel
interrupted himself; the remainder of his sentence was lost in a cloud of
smoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if they didn&rsquo;t send to him,&rdquo;&mdash;Hyacinth persisted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great friend of his&mdash;how can I tell you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Hyacinth looked up at his companion askance, and caught an odd glance,
accompanied with a smile, which the mild, circumspect German directed toward
him. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything against him, my being his friend makes me
just the man to hear it. I can defend him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a possibility that they are not satisfied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean it&mdash;not satisfied?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How shall I say it?&mdash;that they don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust him? And yet they trust me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my boy, depend upon it, there are reasons,&rdquo; Schinkel replied;
and in a moment he added, &ldquo;They know everything&mdash;everything. Oh,
they go straight!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pair pursued the rest of their course for the most part in silence,
Hyacinth being considerably struck with something that dropped from his
companion in answer to a question he asked as to what Eustache Poupin had said
when Schinkel, that evening, first told him what he had come to see him about.
&ldquo;<i>Il vaut du galme&mdash;il vaut du galme</i>:&rdquo; that was the
German&rsquo;s version of the Frenchman&rsquo;s words; and Hyacinth repeated
them over to himself several times, almost with the same accent. They had a
certain soothing effect. In fact the good Schinkel was soothing altogether, as
our hero felt when they stopped at last at the door of his lodging in
Westminster and stood there face to face, while Hyacinth waited&mdash;waited.
The sharpness of his impatience had passed away, and he watched without
irritation the loving manner in which the German shook the ashes out of his big
pipe and laid it to rest in its coffin. It was only after he had gone through
this business with his usual attention to every detail of it that he said,
&ldquo;<i>Also</i>, now for the letter,&rdquo; and, putting his hand inside of
his waistcoat, drew forth the important document. It passed instantly into
Hyacinth&rsquo;s grasp, and our young man transferred it to his own pocket
without looking at it. He thought he saw a shade of disappointment in
Schinkel&rsquo;s ugly, kindly face, at this indication that he should have no
present knowledge of its contents; but he liked that better than his pretending
to say again that it was nothing&mdash;that it was only a release. Schinkel had
now the good sense, or the good taste, not to repeat that remark, and as the
letter pressed against his heart Hyacinth felt still more distinctly that it
was something&mdash;that it was a command. What Schinkel did say, in a moment,
was: &ldquo;Now that you have got it, I am very glad. It is more comfortable
for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t
done your job you would have paid for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Schinkel hesitated a moment while he lingered; then, as Hyacinth turned away,
putting in his door-key, he replied, &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t do yours, so
will you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, as you say, <i>they</i> go straight! Good-night.&rdquo; And our
young man let himself in.
</p>

<p>
The passage and staircase were never lighted, and the lodgers either groped
their way bedward with the infallibility of practice or scraped the wall with a
casual match which, in the milder gloom of day, was visible in a hundred rich
streaks. Hyacinth&rsquo;s room was on the second floor, behind, and as he
approached it he was startled by seeing a light proceed from the crevice under
the door, the imperfect fitting of which was in this manner vividly
illustrated. He stopped and considered this mysterious brightness, and his
first impulse was to connect it with the incident just ushered in by Schinkel;
for what could anything that touched him now be but a part of the same
business? It was natural that some punctual emissary should be awaiting him.
Then it occurred to him that when he went out to call on Lady Aurora, after
tea, he had simply left a tallow candle burning, and that it showed a cynical
spirit on the part of his landlady, who could be so close-fisted for herself,
not to have gone in and put it out. Lastly, it came over him that he had had a
visitor, in his absence, and that the visitor had taken possession of his
apartment till his return, seeking sources of comfort, as was perfectly just.
When he opened the door he found that this last prevision was the right one,
though his visitor was not one of the figures that had risen before him. Mr
Vetch sat there, beside the little table at which Hyacinth did his writing,
with his head resting on his hand and his eyes bent on the floor. He looked up
when Hyacinth appeared, and said, &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t hear you; you are
very quiet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I come in softly, when I&rsquo;m late, for the sake of the
house&mdash;though I am bound to say I am the only lodger who has that
refinement. Besides, you have been asleep,&rdquo; Hyacinth said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I have not been asleep,&rdquo; returned the old man. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t sleep much nowadays.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you have been plunged in meditation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have been thinking.&rdquo; Then Mr Vetch explained that the woman
of the house wouldn&rsquo;t let him come in, at first, till he had given proper
assurances that his intentions were pure and that he was moreover the oldest
friend Mr Robinson had in the world. He had been there for an hour; he thought
he might find him, coming so late.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth answered that he was very glad he had waited and that he was delighted
to see him, and expressed regret that he hadn&rsquo;t known in advance of his
visit, so that he might have something to offer him. He sat down on his bed,
vaguely expectant; he wondered what special purpose had brought the fiddler so
far at that unnatural hour. But he only spoke the truth in saying that he was
glad to see him. Hyacinth had come upstairs in a tremor of desire to be alone
with the revelation that he carried in his pocket, yet the sight of Anastasius
Vetch gave him a sudden relief by postponing solitude. The place where he had
put his letter seemed to throb against his side, yet he was thankful to his old
friend for forcing him still to leave it so. &ldquo;I have been looking at your
books,&rdquo; the fiddler said; &ldquo;you have two or three exquisite
specimens of your own. Oh yes, I recognise your work when I see it; there are
always certain little finer touches. You have a manner, like a master. With
such a talent, such a taste, your future leaves nothing to be desired. You will
make a fortune and become a great celebrity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch sat forward, to sketch this vision; he rested his hands on his knees
and looked very hard at his young friend, as if to challenge him to dispute his
flattering views. The effect of what Hyacinth saw in his face was to give him
immediately the idea that the fiddler knew something, though it was impossible
to guess how he could know it. The Poupins, for instance, had had no time to
communicate with him, even granting that they were capable of that baseness; an
unwarrantable supposition, in spite of Hyacinth&rsquo;s having seen them, less
than an hour before, fall so much below their own standard. With this suspicion
there rushed into Hyacinth&rsquo;s mind an intense determination to dissemble
before his visitor to the last; he might imagine what he liked, but he should
not have a grain of satisfaction&mdash;or rather he should have that of being
led to believe, if possible, that his suspicions were positively vain and idle.
Hyacinth rested his eyes on the books that Mr Vetch had taken down from the
shelf, and admitted that they were very pretty work and that so long as one
didn&rsquo;t become blind or maimed the ability to produce that sort of thing
was a legitimate source of confidence. Then suddenly, as they continued simply
to look at each other, the pressure of the old man&rsquo;s curiosity, the
expression of his probing, beseeching eyes, which had become strange and tragic
in these latter times and completely changed their character, grew so
intolerable that to defend himself Hyacinth took the aggressive and asked him
boldly whether it were simply to look at his work, of which he had half a dozen
specimens in Lomax Place, that he had made a nocturnal pilgrimage. &ldquo;My
dear old friend, you have something on your mind&mdash;some fantastic fear,
some extremely erroneous <i>idée fixe</i>. Why has it taken you to-night, in
particular? Whatever it is, it has brought you here, at an unnatural hour, you
don&rsquo;t know why. I ought of course to be thankful to anything that brings
you here; and so I am, in so far as that it makes me happy. But I can&rsquo;t
like it if it makes <i>you</i> miserable. You&rsquo;re like a nervous mother
whose baby&rsquo;s in bed upstairs; she goes up every five minutes to see if
he&rsquo;s all right&mdash;if he isn&rsquo;t uncovered or hasn&rsquo;t tumbled
out of bed. Dear Mr Vetch, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry; the blanket&rsquo;s
up to my chin, and I haven&rsquo;t tumbled yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth heard himself say these things as if he were listening to another
person; the impudence of them, under the circumstances, seemed to him, somehow,
so rare. But he believed himself to be on the edge of an episode in which
impudence, evidently, must play a considerable part, and he might as well try
his hand at it without delay. The way the old man gazed at him might have
indicated that he too was able to take the measure of his perversity&mdash;that
he knew he was false as he sat there declaring that there was nothing the
matter, while a brand-new revolutionary commission burned in his pocket. But in
a moment Mr Vetch said, very mildly, as if he had really been reassured,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how you read my thoughts. I don&rsquo;t trust you;
I think there are beastly possibilities. It&rsquo;s not true, at any rate, that
I come to look at you every five minutes. You don&rsquo;t know how often I have
resisted my fears&mdash;how I have forced myself to let you alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had better let me come and live with you, as I proposed after
Pinnie&rsquo;s death. Then you will have me always under your eyes,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth, smiling.
</p>

<p>
The old man got up eagerly, and, as Hyacinth did the same, laid his hands upon
his shoulders, holding him close. &ldquo;Will you now, really, my boy? Will you
come to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-night, Mr Vetch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-night has worried me more than any other, I don&rsquo;t know why.
After my tea I had my pipe and a glass, but I couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet; I was
very, very bad. I got to thinking of Pinnie&mdash;she seemed to be in the room.
I felt as if I could put out my hand and touch her. If I believed in ghosts I
should believe I had seen her. She wasn&rsquo;t there for nothing; she was
there to add her fears to mine&mdash;to talk to me about you. I tried to hush
her up, but it was no use&mdash;she drove me out of the house. About ten
o&rsquo;clock I took my hat and stick and came down here. You may judge whether
I thought it important, as I took a cab.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, why do you spend your money so foolishly?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, in
a tone of the most affectionate remonstrance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you come to-night?&rdquo; said the old man, for all rejoinder,
holding him still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, it would be simpler for you to stay here. I see perfectly that
you are ill and nervous. You can take the bed, and I&rsquo;ll spend the night
in the chair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fiddler thought a moment. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll hate me if I subject you
to such discomfort as that; and that&rsquo;s just what I don&rsquo;t
want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a bit different in your room; there, as here, I shall
have to sleep in a chair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get another room; we shall be close together,&rdquo; the
fiddler went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;ll get another room at this hour of the night,
with your little house stuffed full and your people all in bed? My poor
Anastasius, you are very bad; your reason totters on its throne,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth, humorously and indulgently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, we&rsquo;ll get a room to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll move into
another house, where there are two, side by side.&rdquo; Hyacinth&rsquo;s tone
was evidently soothing to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Comme vous y allez!</i>&rdquo; the young man continued. &ldquo;Excuse
me if I remind you that in case of my leaving this place I have to give a
fortnight&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re backing out!&rdquo; the old man exclaimed, dropping his
hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pinnie wouldn&rsquo;t have said that,&rdquo; Hyacinth returned.
&ldquo;If you are acting, if you are speaking, at the prompting of her pure
spirit, you had better act and speak exactly as she would have done. She would
have believed me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Believed you? Believed what? What is there to believe? If you&rsquo;ll
make me a promise, I will believe that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you any promise you like,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, any promise I like&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t what I want! I want just
one very particular little pledge; and that is really what I came here for
to-night. It came over me that I&rsquo;ve been an ass, all this time, never to
have demanded it of you before. Give it to me now, and I will go home quietly
and leave you in peace.&rdquo; Hyacinth, assenting in advance, requested again
that he would formulate his demand, and then the old man said, &ldquo;Well,
promise me that you will never, under any circumstances whatever, do
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything that those people expect of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those people?&rdquo; Hyacinth repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t torment me with pretending not to understand!&rdquo; the
old man begged. &ldquo;You know the people I mean. I can&rsquo;t call them by
their names, because I don&rsquo;t know them. But you do, and they know
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had no desire to torment Mr Vetch, but he was capable of reflecting
that to enter into his thought too easily would be tantamount to betraying
himself. &ldquo;I suppose I know the people you have in mind,&rdquo; he said,
in a moment; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t grasp the idea of the
promise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they want to make use of you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; said Hyacinth. &ldquo;You think they want me
to touch off some train for them. Well, if that&rsquo;s what troubles you, you
may sleep sound. I shall never do any of their work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A radiant light came into the fiddler&rsquo;s face, and he stared, as if this
assurance were too fair for nature. &ldquo;Do you take your oath on that? Never
anything, anything, anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never anything at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you swear it to me by the memory of that good woman of whom we have
been speaking and whom we both loved?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear old Pinnie&rsquo;s memory? Willingly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man sank down in his chair and buried his face in his hands; the next
moment his companion heard him sobbing. Ten minutes later he was content to
take his departure, and Hyacinth went out with him to look for another cab.
They found an ancient four-wheeler stationed languidly at a crossing of the
ways, and before Mr Vetch got into it he asked his young friend to kiss him.
That young friend watched the vehicle get itself into motion and rattle away;
he saw it turn a neighbouring corner. Then he approached the nearest gas-lamp
and drew from his breast-pocket the letter that Schinkel had given him.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3><a name="chap45"></a>XLV</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;And Madame Grandoni, then?&rdquo; asked Hyacinth, reluctant to turn
away. He felt pretty sure that he should never knock at that door again, and
the desire was strong in him to see once more, for the last time, the ancient,
troubled <i>suivante</i> of the Princess, whom he had always liked. She had
seemed to him ever to be in the slightly ridiculous position of a confidant of
tragedy in whom the heroine should have ceased to confide.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>E andata via, caro signorino</i>,&rdquo; said Assunta, smiling at him
as she stood there holding the door open.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has gone away? Bless me, when did she go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is now five days, dear young sir. She has returned to our
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; exclaimed Hyacinth, disappointedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>E possibilissimo!</i>&rdquo; said Assunta. Then she added,
&ldquo;There were many times when she almost went; but this
time&mdash;<i>capisce</i>&mdash;&rdquo; And without finishing her sentence the
Princess&rsquo;s Roman tirewoman indulged in a subtle, suggestive, indefinable
play of expression, to which her hands and shoulders contributed, as well as
her lips and eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth looked at her long enough to catch any meaning that she might have
wished to convey, but gave no sign of apprehending it. He only remarked,
gravely, &ldquo;In short she is here no more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the worst is that she will probably never come back. She
didn&rsquo;t go for a long time, but when she decided herself it was
finished,&rdquo; Assunta declared. &ldquo;<i>Peccato!</i>&rdquo; she added,
with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have liked to see her again&mdash;I should have liked to bid
her good-bye.&rdquo; Hyacinth lingered there in strange, melancholy vagueness;
since he had been told the Princess was not at home he had no reason for
remaining, save the possibility that she might return before he turned away.
This possibility, however, was small, for it was only nine o&rsquo;clock, the
middle of the evening&mdash;too early an hour for her to reappear, if, as
Assunta said, she had gone out after tea. He looked up and down the Crescent,
gently swinging his stick, and became conscious in a moment that Assunta was
regarding him with tender interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should have come back sooner; then perhaps she wouldn&rsquo;t have
gone, <i>povera vecchia</i>,&rdquo; she rejoined in a moment. &ldquo;It is too
many days since you have been here. She liked you&mdash;I know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She liked me, but she didn&rsquo;t like me to come,&rdquo; said
Hyacinth. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that why she went, because we came?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, that other one&mdash;with the long legs&mdash;yes. But you are
better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Princess doesn&rsquo;t think so, and she is the right judge,&rdquo;
Hyacinth replied, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, who knows what she thinks? It is not for me to say. But you had
better come in and wait. I dare say she won&rsquo;t be long, and it would
gratify her to find you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated. &ldquo;I am not sure of that.&rdquo; Then he asked,
&ldquo;Did she go out alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Sola, sola</i>,&rdquo; said Assunta, smiling. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
be afraid; you were the first!&rdquo; And she flung open the door of the little
drawing-room, with an air of irresistible solicitation and sympathy.
</p>

<p>
He sat there nearly an hour, in the chair the Princess habitually used, under
her shaded lamp, with a dozen objects around him which seemed as much a part of
herself as if they had been folds of her dress or even tones of her voice. His
thoughts were tremendously active, but his body was too tired for restlessness;
he had not been at work, and had been walking about all day, to fill the time;
so that he simply reclined there, with his head on one of the Princess&rsquo;s
cushions, his feet on one of her little stools&mdash;one of the ugly ones, that
belonged to the house&mdash;and his respiration coming quickly, like that of a
man in a state of acute agitation. Hyacinth was agitated now, but it was not
because he was waiting for the Princess; a deeper source of emotion had been
opened to him, and he had not on the present occasion more sharpness of
impatience than had already visited him at certain moments of the past twenty
hours. He had not closed his eyes the night before, and the day had not made up
for that torment. A fever of reflection had descended upon him, and the range
of his imagination had been wide. It whirled him through circles of
immeasurable compass; and this is the reason that, thinking of many things
while he sat in the Princess&rsquo;s chair, he wondered why, after all, he had
come to Madeira Crescent, and what interest he could have in seeing the lady of
the house. He had a very complete sense that everything was over between them;
that the link had snapped which bound them so closely together for a while. And
this was not simply because for a long time now he had received no sign nor
communication from her, no invitation to come back, no inquiry as to why his
visits had stopped. It was not because he had seen her go in and out with Paul
Muniment, nor because it had suited Prince Casamassima to point the moral of
her doing so, nor even because, quite independently of the Prince, he believed
her to be more deeply absorbed in her acquaintance with that superior young man
than she had ever been in her relations with himself. The reason, so far as he
became conscious of it in his fitful meditations, could only be a strange,
detached curiosity&mdash;strange and detached because everything else of his
past had been engulfed in the abyss that opened before him as, after Mr Vetch
had left him, he stood under the lamp in a paltry Westminster street. That had
swallowed up all familiar feelings, and yet out of the ruin had sprung the
impulse which brought him to where he sat.
</p>

<p>
The solution of his difficulty&mdash;he flattered himself he had arrived at
it&mdash;involved a winding-up of his affairs; and though, even if no solution
had been required, he would have felt clearly that he had been dropped, yet as
even in that case it would have been sweet to him to bid her good-bye, so, at
present, the desire for some last vision of her own hurrying fate could still
appeal to him. If things had not gone well for him he was still capable of
wondering whether they looked better for her. It is a singular fact, but there
rose in his mind a sort of incongruous desire to pity her. All these were odd
feelings enough, and by the time half an hour had elapsed they had throbbed
themselves into weariness and into slumber. While he remembered that he was
waiting now in a very different frame from that in which he waited for her in
South Street the first time he went to see her, he closed his eyes and lost
himself. His unconsciousness lasted, he afterwards perceived, nearly half an
hour; it terminated in his becoming aware that the lady of the house was
standing before him. Assunta was behind her, and as he opened his eyes she took
from her mistress the bonnet and mantle of which the Princess divested herself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s charming of you to have waited,&rdquo; the latter said,
smiling down at him with all her old kindness. &ldquo;You are very
tired&mdash;don&rsquo;t get up; that&rsquo;s the best chair, and you must keep
it.&rdquo; She made him remain where he was; she placed herself near him on a
smaller seat; she declared that she was not tired herself, that she
didn&rsquo;t know what was the matter with her&mdash;nothing tired her now; she
exclaimed on the time that had elapsed since he had last called, as if she were
reminded of it simply by seeing him again; and she insisted that he should have
some tea&mdash;he looked so much as if he needed it. She considered him with
deeper attention, and wished to know what was the matter with him&mdash;what he
had done to use himself up; adding that she must begin and look after him
again, for while she had the care of him that kind of thing didn&rsquo;t
happen. In response to this Hyacinth made a great confession: he admitted that
he had stayed away from work and simply amused himself&mdash;amused himself by
loafing about London all day. This didn&rsquo;t pay&mdash;he was beginning to
discover it as he grew older; it was doubtless a sign of increasing years when
one began to perceive that wanton pleasures were hollow and that to stick to
one&rsquo;s tools was not only more profitable but more refreshing. However, he
did stick to them, as a general thing; that was no doubt partly why, from the
absence of the habit of it, a day off turned out to be rather a grind. When
Hyacinth had not seen the Princess for some time he always, on meeting her
again, had a renewed, tremendous sense of her beauty, and he had it to-night in
an extraordinary degree. Splendid as that beauty had ever been, it seemed
clothed at present in transcendent glory, and (if that which was already
supremely fine could be capable of greater refinement) to have worked itself
free of all earthly grossness and been purified and consecrated by her new
life. Her gentleness, when she was in the mood for it, was quite divine (it had
always the irresistible charm that it was the humility of a high spirit), and
on this occasion she gave herself up to it. Whether it was because he had the
consciousness of resting his eyes upon her for the last time, or because she
wished to be particularly pleasant to him in order to make up for having, amid
other preoccupations, rather dropped him of late (it was probable the effect
was a product of both causes), at all events the sight of her loveliness seemed
none the less a privilege than it had done the night he went into her box, at
the play, and her presence lifted the weight from his soul. He suffered himself
to be coddled and absently, even if radiantly, smiled at, and his state of mind
was such that it could produce no alteration of his pain to see that on the
Princess&rsquo;s part these were inexpensive gifts. She had sent Assunta to
bring them tea, and when the tray arrived she gave him cup after cup, with
every restorative demonstration; but he had not sat with her a quarter of an
hour before he perceived that she scarcely measured a word he said to her or a
word that she herself uttered. If she had the best intention of being nice to
him, by way of compensation, this compensation was for a wrong that was far
from vividly present to her mind. Two points became perfectly clear: one was
that she was thinking of something very different from her present, her past,
or her future relations with Hyacinth Robinson; the other was that he was
superseded indeed. This was so completely the case that it did not even occur
to her, it was evident, that the sense of supersession might be cruel to the
young man. If she was charming to him it was because she was good-natured and
he had been hanging off, and not because she had done him an injury. Perhaps,
after all, she hadn&rsquo;t, for he got the impression that it might be no
great loss of comfort not to constitute part of her life to-day. It was
manifest from her eye, from her smile, from every movement and tone, and indeed
from all the irradiation of her beauty, that that life to-day was tremendously
wound up. If he had come to Madeira Crescent because he was curious to see how
she was getting on, it was sufficiently intimated to him that she was getting
on well; that is that she was living more than ever on high hopes and bold
plans and far-reaching combinations. These things, from his own point of view,
ministered less to happiness, and to be mixed up with them was perhaps not so
much greater a sign that one had not lived for nothing, than the grim
arrangement which, in the interest of peace, he had just arrived at with
himself. She asked him why he had not been to see her for so long, quite as if
this failure were only a vulgar form of social neglect; and she scarcely seemed
to notice whether it were a good or a poor excuse when he said he had stayed
away because he knew her to be extremely busy. But she did not deny the
impeachment; she admitted that she had been busier than ever in her life
before. She looked at him as if he would know what that meant, and he remarked
that he was very sorry for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you think it&rsquo;s all a mistake? Yes, I know that. Perhaps it
is; but if it is, it&rsquo;s a magnificent one. If you were scared about me
three or four months ago, I don&rsquo;t know what you would think
to-day&mdash;if you knew! I have risked everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fortunately I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, how should you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to tell the truth,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that is really the
reason I haven&rsquo;t been back here till to-night. I haven&rsquo;t wanted to
know&mdash;I have feared and hated to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why did you come at last?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hyacinth hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Out of a kind of inconsistent
curiosity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose then you would like me to tell you where I have been to-night,
eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, my curiosity is satisfied. I have learned something&mdash;what I
mainly wanted to know&mdash;without your telling me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stared an instant. &ldquo;Ah, you mean whether Madame Grandoni was gone? I
suppose Assunta told you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Assunta told me, and I was sorry to hear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess looked grave, as if her old friend&rsquo;s departure had been
indeed a very serious incident. &ldquo;You may imagine how I feel it! It leaves
me completely alone; it makes, in the eyes of the world, an immense difference
in my position. However, I don&rsquo;t consider the eyes of the world. At any
rate, she couldn&rsquo;t put up with me any more&mdash;it appears that I am
more and more shocking; and it was written!&rdquo; On Hyacinth&rsquo;s asking
what the old lady would do, she replied, &ldquo;I suppose she will go and live
with my husband.&rdquo; Five minutes later she inquired of him whether the same
reason that he had mentioned just before was the explanation of his absence
from Audley Court. Mr Muniment had told her that he had not been near him and
his sister for more than a month.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t the fear of learning something that would make me
uneasy: because, somehow, in the first place it isn&rsquo;t natural to feel
uneasy about Paul, and in the second, if it were, he never lets one see
anything. It is simply the general sense of real divergence of view. When that
divergence becomes sharp, it is better not to pester each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see what you mean. But you might go and see his sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, simply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, neither do I!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed; while her visitor
remained conscious of the perfect composure, the absence of false shame, with
which she had referred to their common friend. But she was silent after this,
and he judged that he had stayed long enough and sufficiently taxed a
preoccupied attention. He got up, and was bidding her good-night, when she
checked him by saying, suddenly, &ldquo;By the way, your not going to see so
good a friend as Mr Muniment, because you disapprove to-day of his work,
suggests to me that you will be in an awkward fix, with your disapprovals, the
day you are called upon to serve the cause according to your vow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course I have thought of that,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And would it be indiscreet to ask what you have thought?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, so many things, Princess! It would take me a long time to
say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never talked to you about this, because it seemed to me
indelicate, and the whole thing too much a secret of your own breast for even
so intimate a friend as I have been to have a right to meddle with it. But I
have wondered much&mdash;seeing that you cared less and less for the
people&mdash;how you would reconcile your change of heart with the performance
of your engagement. I pity you, my poor friend,&rdquo; the Princess went on,
with a heavenly sweetness, &ldquo;for I can imagine nothing more terrible than
to find yourself face to face with such an engagement, and to feel at the same
time that the spirit which prompted it is dead within you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Terrible, terrible, most terrible,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, gravely,
looking at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I pray God it may never be your fate!&rdquo; The Princess hesitated
a moment; then she added, &ldquo;I see you feel it. Heaven help us all!&rdquo;
She paused, then went on: &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I tell you, after all? A
short time ago I had a visit from Mr Vetch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was kind of you to see him,&rdquo; said Hyacinth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was delightful, I assure you. But do you know what he came for? To
beg me, on his knees, to snatch you away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To snatch me away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From the danger that hangs over you. Poor man, he was very
pathetic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, he has talked to me about it,&rdquo; Hyacinth said. &ldquo;He
has picked up the idea, but he knows nothing whatever about it. And how did he
expect that you would be able to snatch me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He left that to me; he had only a general conviction of my influence
with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he thought you would exercise it to make me back out? He does you
injustice; you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Hyacinth exclaimed, with a laugh.
&ldquo;In that case, taking one false position with another, yours would be no
better than mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, speaking seriously, I am perfectly quiet about you and about myself.
I know you won&rsquo;t be called,&rdquo; the Princess returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I inquire how you know it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After a slight hesitation she replied, &ldquo;Mr Muniment tells me so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how does he know it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have information. My dear fellow,&rdquo; the Princess went on,
&ldquo;you are so much out of it now that if I were to tell you, you
wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, no doubt I am out of it; but I still have a right to say, all the
same, in contradiction to your imputation of a moment ago, that I care for the
people exactly as much as I ever did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor Hyacinth, my dear infatuated little aristocrat, was that ever
very much?&rdquo; the Princess asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was enough, and it is still enough, to make me willing to lay down my
life for anything that will really help them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and of course you must decide for yourself what that is; or,
rather, what it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t decide when I gave my promise. I agreed to take the
decision of others,&rdquo; Hyacinth said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you said just now that in relation to this business of yours you
had thought of many things,&rdquo; the Princess rejoined. &ldquo;Have you ever,
by chance, thought of anything that <i>will</i> help the people?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You call me fantastic names, but I&rsquo;m one of them myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what you are going to say!&rdquo; the Princess broke in.
&ldquo;You are going to say that it will help them to do what you do&mdash;to
do their work and earn their wages. That&rsquo;s beautiful so far as it goes.
But what do you propose for the thousands and thousands for whom no
work&mdash;on the overcrowded earth, under the pitiless heaven&mdash;is to be
found? There is less and less work in the world, and there are more and more
people to do the little that there is. The old ferocious selfishnesses
<i>must</i> come down. They won&rsquo;t come down gracefully, so they must be
smashed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tone in which the Princess uttered these words made Hyacinth&rsquo;s heart
beat fast, and there was something so inspiring in her devoted fairness that
the vision of a great heroism flashed up again before him, in all the splendour
it had lost&mdash;the idea of a tremendous risk and an unregarded sacrifice.
Such a woman as that, at such a moment, made every scruple seem a prudence and
every compunction a cowardice. &ldquo;I wish to God I could see it as you see
it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after he had looked at her a minute in silent
admiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see simply this: that what we are doing is at least worth trying, and
that as none of those who have the power, the place, the means, will try
anything else, on <i>their</i> head be the responsibility, on <i>their</i> head
be the blood!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; said Hyacinth, clasping his hands and feeling that he
trembled, &ldquo;dearest Princess, if anything should happen to
<i>you</i>&mdash;&rdquo; and his voice fell; the horror of it, a dozen hideous
images of her possible perversity and her possible punishment were again before
him, as he had already seen them in sinister musings; they seemed to him worse
than anything he had imagined for himself.
</p>

<p>
She threw back her head, looking at him almost in anger. &ldquo;To me! And pray
why not to me? What title have I to exemption, to security, more than any one
else? Why am I so sacrosanct and so precious?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply because there is no one in the world, and there has never been
any one in the world, like you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; said the Princess, with a kind of dry impatience,
turning away.
</p>

<p>
The manner in which she spoke put an end to their conversation. It expressed an
indifference to what it might interest him to think about her to-day, and even
a contempt for it, which brought tears to his eyes. His tears, however, were
concealed by the fact that he bent his head over her hand, which he had taken
to kiss; after which he left the room without looking at her.

<h3><a name="chap46"></a>XLVI</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;I have received a letter from your husband,&rdquo; Paul Muniment said to
the Princess, the next evening, as soon as he came into the room. He announced
this fact with a kind of bald promptitude and with a familiarity of manner
which showed that his visit was one of a closely-connected series. The Princess
was evidently not a little surprised by it, and immediately asked how in the
world the Prince could know his address. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it have been by
your old lady?&rdquo; Muniment inquired. &ldquo;He must have met her in Paris.
It is from Paris that he writes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an incorrigible cad!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that&mdash;for writing to me. I have his letter in my
pocket, and I will show it to you if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, nothing would induce me to touch anything he has
touched,&rdquo; the Princess replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You touch his money, my dear lady,&rdquo; Muniment remarked, with the
quiet smile of a man who sees things as they are.
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated a little. &ldquo;Yes, I make an exception for that,
because it hurts him, it makes him suffer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think, on the contrary, it would gratify him by showing you in
a condition of weakness and dependence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not when he knows I don&rsquo;t use it for myself. What exasperates him
is that it is devoted to ends that he hates almost as much as he hates me and
yet which he can&rsquo;t call selfish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; said Muniment, with that tone of
pleasant reasonableness that he used when he was most imperturbable. &ldquo;His
letter satisfies me of that.&rdquo; The Princess stared, at this, and asked him
what he was coming to&mdash;whether he was leading up to advising her to go
back and live with her husband. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I would go so
far as to advise,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;when I have so much benefit from
seeing you here, on your present footing, that wouldn&rsquo;t sound well. But
I&rsquo;ll just make bold to prophesy that you will go before very long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And on what does that extraordinary prediction rest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On this plain fact&mdash;that you will have nothing to live upon. You
decline to read the Prince&rsquo;s letter, but if you were to look at it it
would give you evidence of what I mean. He informs me that I need count upon no
more supplies from your hands, as you yourself will receive no more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He addresses you that way, in plain terms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t call them very plain, because the letter is written in
French, and I naturally have had a certain difficulty in making it out, in
spite of my persevering study of the tongue and the fine example set me by poor
Robinson. But that appears to be the gist of the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you can repeat such an insult to me without the smallest apparent
discomposure? You&rsquo;re the most remarkable man!&rdquo; the Princess broke
out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why is it an insult? It is the simple truth. I do take your
money,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You take it for a sacred cause; you don&rsquo;t take it for
yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Prince isn&rsquo;t obliged to look at that,&rdquo; Muniment
rejoined, laughing.
</p>

<p>
His companion was silent for a moment; then, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you
were on his side,&rdquo; she replied, gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you know on what side I am!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does he know? What business has he to address you so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he knows from Madame Grandoni. She has told him that I have
great influence upon you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was welcome to tell him that!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His reasoning, therefore, has been that when I find you have nothing
more to give to the cause I will let you go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing more? And does he count <i>me</i>, myself, and every pulse of my
being, every capacity of my nature, as nothing?&rdquo; the Princess cried, with
shining eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Apparently he thinks that I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, as for that, after all, I have known that you care far more for my
money than for me. But it has made no difference to me,&rdquo; said the
Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you see that by your own calculation the Prince is right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; Muniment&rsquo;s hostess replied, &ldquo;my interest
in you never depended on your interest in me. It depended wholly on a sense of
your great destinies. I suppose that what you began to tell me is that he stops
my allowance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From the first of next month. He has taken legal advice. It is now
clear&mdash;so he tells me&mdash;that you forfeit your settlements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can I not take legal advice, too?&rdquo; the Princess asked.
&ldquo;Surely I can contest that. I can forfeit my settlements only by an act
of my own. The act that led to our separation was <i>his</i> act; he turned me
out of his house by physical violence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Muniment, displaying even in this simple
discussion his easy aptitude for argument; &ldquo;but since then there have
been acts of your own&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped a moment, smiling; then he went
on: &ldquo;Your whole connection with a secret society constitutes an act, and
so does your exercise of the pleasure, which you appreciate so highly, of
feeding it with money extorted from an old Catholic and princely family. You
know how little it is to be desired that these matters should come to
light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why in the world need they come to light? Allegations in plenty, of
course, he would have, but not a particle of proof. Even if Madame Grandoni
were to testify against me, which is inconceivable, she would not be able to
produce a definite fact.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She would be able to produce the fact that you had a little bookbinder
staying for a month in your house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What has that to do with it?&rdquo; the Princess demanded. &ldquo;If you
mean that that is a circumstance which would put me in the wrong as against the
Prince, is there not, on the other side, this circumstance, that while our
young friend was staying with me Madame Grandoni herself, a person of the
highest and most conspicuous respectability, never saw fit to withdraw from me
her countenance and protection? Besides, why shouldn&rsquo;t I have my
bookbinder, just as I might have (and the Prince should surely appreciate my
consideration in not having) my physician and my chaplain?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I not your chaplain?&rdquo; said Muniment, with a laugh. &ldquo;And
does the bookbinder usually dine at the Princess&rsquo;s table?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not, if he&rsquo;s an artist? In the old times, I know, artists
dined with the servants; but not to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would be for the court to appreciate,&rdquo; Muniment remarked. And
in a moment he added, &ldquo;Allow me to call your attention to the fact that
Madame Grandoni <i>has</i> left you&mdash;<i>has</i> withdrawn her countenance
and protection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but not for Hyacinth!&rdquo; the Princess returned, in a tone which
would have made the fortune of an actress if an actress could have caught it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the bookbinder or for the chaplain, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But
that&rsquo;s only a detail,&rdquo; said Muniment. &ldquo;In any case, I
shouldn&rsquo;t in the least care for your going to law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess rested her eyes upon him for a while in silence, and at last she
replied, &ldquo;I was speaking just now of your great destinies, but every now
and then you do something, you say something, that makes me doubt of them.
It&rsquo;s when you seem afraid. That&rsquo;s terribly against your being a
first-rate man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know you have thought me a coward from the first of your knowing
me. But what does it matter? I haven&rsquo;t the smallest pretension to being a
first-rate man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are deep, and you are provoking!&rdquo; murmured the Princess,
with a sombre eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; Muniment continued, without heeding
this somewhat passionate ejaculation&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you remember how,
the other day, you accused me of being not only a coward but a traitor; of
playing false; of wanting, as you said, to back out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most distinctly. How can I help its coming over me, at times, that you
have incalculable ulterior views and are only using me&mdash;only using us all?
But I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; I&rsquo;m genuine,&rdquo; said Paul Muniment, simply, yet in a
tone which might have implied that the discussion was idle. And he immediately
went on, with a transition too abrupt for perfect civility: &ldquo;The best
reason in the world for your not having a lawsuit with your husband is this:
that when you haven&rsquo;t a penny left you will be obliged to go back and
live with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean, when I haven&rsquo;t a penny left? Haven&rsquo;t I my
own property?&rdquo; the Princess demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Prince tells me that you have drawn upon your own property at such a
rate that the income to be derived from it amounts, to his positive knowledge,
to no more than a thousand francs&mdash;forty pounds&mdash;a year. Surely, with
your habits and tastes, you can&rsquo;t live on forty pounds. I should add that
your husband implies that your property, originally, was but a small
affair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have the most extraordinary tone,&rdquo; observed the Princess,
gravely. &ldquo;What you appear to wish to express is simply this: that from
the moment I have no more money to give you I am of no more value than the skin
of an orange.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment looked down at his shoe awhile. His companion&rsquo;s words had
brought a flush into his cheek; he appeared to admit to himself and to her
that, at the point at which their conversation had arrived, there was a natural
difficulty in his delivering himself. But presently he raised his head, showing
a face still slightly embarrassed but none the less bright and frank. &ldquo;I
have no intention whatever of saying anything harsh or offensive to you, but
since you challenge me perhaps it is well that I should let you know that I
<i>do</i> consider that in giving your money&mdash;or, rather, your
husband&rsquo;s&mdash;to our business you gave the most valuable thing you had
to contribute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the day of plain truths!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed, with a
laugh that was not expressive of pleasure. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t count then
any devotion, any intelligence, that I may have placed at your service, even
rating my faculties modestly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I count your intelligence, but I don&rsquo;t count your devotion, and
one is nothing without the other. You are not trusted at headquarters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not trusted!&rdquo; the Princess repeated, with her splendid stare.
&ldquo;Why, I thought I could be hanged to-morrow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They may let you hang, perfectly, without letting you act. You are
liable to be weary of us,&rdquo; Paul Muniment went on; &ldquo;and, indeed, I
think you are weary of us already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you <i>must</i> be a first-rate man&mdash;you are such a
brute!&rdquo; replied the Princess, who noticed, as she had noticed before,
that he pronounced &lsquo;weary&rsquo; <i>weery</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you were weary of <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Muniment,
blushing again. &ldquo;You can never live poor&mdash;you don&rsquo;t begin to
know the meaning of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, I am not tired of you,&rdquo; the Princess returned, in a
strange tone. &ldquo;In a moment you will make me cry with passion, and no man
has done that for years. I was very poor when I was a girl,&rdquo; she added,
in a different manner. &ldquo;You yourself recognised it just now, in speaking
of the insignificant character of my fortune.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It had to be a fortune, to be insignificant,&rdquo; said Muniment,
smiling. &ldquo;You will go back to your husband!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To this declaration she made no answer whatever; she only sat looking at him in
a sort of desperate calmness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, after all, why they
trust you more than they trust me,&rdquo; she remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not sure that they do,&rdquo; said Muniment. &ldquo;I have heard
something this evening which suggests that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And may one know what it is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A communication which I should have expected to be made through me has
been made through another person.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A communication?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To Hyacinth Robinson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To Hyacinth&mdash;&rdquo; The Princess sprang up; she had turned pale in
a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has got his ticket; but they didn&rsquo;t send it through me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean his orders? He was here last night,&rdquo; the Princess
said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fellow named Schinkel, a German&mdash;whom you don&rsquo;t know, I
think, but who was a sort of witness, with me and another, of his
undertaking&mdash;came to see me this evening. It was through him the summons
came, and he put Hyacinth up to it on Sunday night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On Sunday night?&rdquo; The Princess stared. &ldquo;Why, he was here
yesterday, and he talked of it, and he told me nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was quite right of him, bless him!&rdquo; Muniment exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The Princess closed her eyes a moment, and when she opened them again Muniment
had risen and was standing before her. &ldquo;What do they want him to
do?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am like Hyacinth; I think I had better not tell you&mdash;at least
till it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when will it be over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They give him several days and, I believe, minute instructions,&rdquo;
said Muniment, &ldquo;with, however, considerable discretion in respect to
seizing his chance. The thing is made remarkably easy for him. All this I know
from Schinkel, who himself knew nothing on Sunday, being a mere medium of
transmission, but who saw Hyacinth yesterday morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Schinkel trusts you, then?&rdquo; the Princess remarked.
</p>

<p>
Muniment looked at her steadily a moment. &ldquo;Yes, but he won&rsquo;t trust
you. Hyacinth is to receive a card of invitation to a certain big house,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;a card with the name left in blank, so that he may fill it
out himself. It is to be good for each of two grand parties which are to be
given at a few days&rsquo; interval. That&rsquo;s why they give him the
job&mdash;because at a grand party he&rsquo;ll look in his place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He will like that,&rdquo; said the Princess,
musingly&mdash;&ldquo;repaying hospitality with a pistol-shot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t like it he needn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess made no rejoinder to this, but in a moment she said, &ldquo;I can
easily find out the place you mean&mdash;the big house where two parties are to
be given at a few days&rsquo; interval and where the master is worth your
powder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Easily, no doubt. And do you want to warn him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I want to do the business first, so that it won&rsquo;t be left for
another. If Hyacinth will look in his place at a grand party, should not I look
still more in mine? And as I know the individual I should be able to approach
him without exciting the smallest suspicion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muniment appeared to consider her suggestion a moment, as if it were practical
and interesting; but presently he answered, placidly, &ldquo;To fall by your
hand would be too good for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;However he falls, will it be useful, valuable?&rdquo; the Princess
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying. He&rsquo;s a very bad institution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you mean to go near Hyacinth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I wish to leave him free,&rdquo; Muniment answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Paul Muniment,&rdquo; murmured the Princess, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> a
first-rate man!&rdquo; She sank down upon the sofa and sat looking up at him.
&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, why have you told me this?&rdquo; she broke out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So that you should not be able to throw it up at me, later, that I had
not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She threw herself over, burying her face in the cushions, and remained so for
some minutes, in silence. Muniment watched her awhile, without speaking; but at
last he remarked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to aggravate you, but you
<i>will</i> go back!&rdquo; The words failed to cause her even to raise her
head, and after a moment he quietly went out.

<p>
That the Princess had done with him, done with him for ever, remained the most
vivid impression that Hyacinth had carried away from Madeira Crescent the night
before. He went home, and he flung himself on his narrow bed, where the
consolation of sleep again descended upon him. But he woke up with the earliest
dawn, and the beginning of a new day was a quick revival of pain. He was
over-past, he had become vague, he was extinct. The things that Sholto had said
to him came back to him, and the compassion of foreknowledge that Madame
Grandoni had shown him from the first. Of Paul Muniment he only thought to
wonder whether he knew. An insurmountable desire to do justice to him, for the
very reason that there might be a temptation to oblique thoughts, forbade him
to challenge his friend even in imagination. He vaguely wondered whether
<i>he</i> would ever be superseded; but this possibility faded away in a
stronger light&mdash;a kind of dazzling vision of some great tribuneship, which
swept before him now and again and in which the figure of the Princess herself
seemed merged and extinguished. When full morning came at last, and he got up,
it brought with it, in the restlessness which made it impossible to him to
remain in his room, a return of that beginning of an answerless question,
&lsquo;After all&mdash;after all&mdash;?&rsquo; which the Princess had planted
there the night before when she spoke so bravely in the name of the Revolution.
&lsquo;After all&mdash;after all, since nothing else was tried, or would,
apparently, ever be tried&mdash;&rsquo; He had a sense of his mind, which had
been made up, falling to pieces again; but that sense in turn lost itself in a
shudder which was already familiar&mdash;the horror of the reappearance, on his
part, of the imbrued hands of his mother. This loathing of the idea of a
<i>repetition</i> had not been sharp, strangely enough, till his summons came;
in all his previous meditations the growth of his reluctance to act for the
&lsquo;party of action&rsquo; had not been the fear of a personal stain, but
the simple extension of his observation. Yet now the idea of the personal stain
made him horribly sick; it seemed by itself to make service impossible. It rose
before him like a kind of backward accusation of his mother; to suffer it to
start out in the life of her son was in a manner to place her own forgotten,
redeemed pollution again in the eye of the world. The thought that was most of
all with him was that he had time&mdash;he had time; he was grateful for that,
and saw a kind of delicacy in their having given him a margin&mdash;not
condemned him to be pressed by the hours. He had another day, he had two days,
he might take three, he might take several. He knew he should be terribly weary
of them before they were over; but for that matter they would be over whenever
he liked. Anyhow, he went forth again into the streets, into the squares, into
the parks, solicited by an aimless desire to steep himself yet once again in
the great indifferent city which he knew and loved and which had had so many of
his smiles and tears and confidences. The day was gray and damp, though no rain
fell, and London had never appeared to him to wear more proudly and publicly
the stamp of her imperial history. He passed slowly to and fro over Westminster
bridge and watched the black barges drift on the great brown river, and looked
up at the huge fretted palace that rose there as a fortress of the social order
which he, like the young David, had been commissioned to attack with a sling
and a pebble. At last he made his way to St James&rsquo;s Park, and he strolled
about a long time. He revolved around it, and he went a considerable distance
up the thoroughfare that communicates with Pimlico. He stopped at a certain
point and came back again, and then he retraced his steps in the former
direction. He looked in the windows of shops, and he looked in particular into
the long, glazed expanse of that establishment in which, at that hour of the
day, Millicent Henning discharged superior functions. Millicent&rsquo;s image
had descended upon him after he came out, and now it moved before him as he
went, it clung to him, it refused to quit him. He made, in truth, no effort to
drive it away; he held fast to it in return, and it murmured strange things in
his ear. She had been so jolly to him on Sunday; she was such a strong,
obvious, simple nature, with such a generous breast and such a freedom from the
sophistries of civilisation. All that he had ever liked in her came back to him
now with a finer air, and there was a moment, during which he hung over the
rail of the bridge that spans the lake in St James&rsquo;s Park and
mechanically followed the movement of the swans, when he asked himself whether,
at bottom, he hadn&rsquo;t liked her better, almost, than any one. He tried to
think he had, he wanted to think he had, and he seemed to see the look her eyes
would have if he should tell her that he had. Something of that sort had really
passed between them on Sunday; only the business that had come up since had
superseded it. Now the taste of the vague, primitive comfort that his Sunday
had given him came back to him, and he asked himself whether he mightn&rsquo;t
know it a second time. After he had thought he couldn&rsquo;t again wish for
anything, he found himself wishing that he might believe there was something
Millicent could do for him. Mightn&rsquo;t she help him&mdash;mightn&rsquo;t
she even extricate him? He was looking into a window&mdash;not that of her own
shop&mdash;when a vision rose before him of a quick flight with her, for an
undefined purpose, to an undefined spot; and he was glad, at that moment, to
have his back turned to the people in the street, because his face suddenly
grew red to the tips of his ears. Again and again, all the same, he indulged in
the reflection that spontaneous, uncultivated minds often have inventions,
inspirations. Moreover, whether Millicent should have any or not, he might at
least feel her arms around him. He didn&rsquo;t exactly know what good it would
do him or what door it would open; but he should like it. The sensation was not
one he could afford to defer, but the nearest moment at which he could enjoy it
would be that evening. <i>He</i> had thrown over everything, but she would be
busy all day; nevertheless, it would be a gain, it would be a kind of
foretaste, to see her earlier, to have three words with her. He wrestled with
the temptation to go into her haberdasher&rsquo;s, because he knew she
didn&rsquo;t like it (he had tried it once, of old); as the visits of
gentlemen, even when ostensible purchasers (there were people watching about
who could tell who was who), compromised her in the eyes of her employers. This
was not an ordinary case, however; and though he hovered about the place a long
time, undecided, embarrassed, half ashamed, at last he went in, as by an
irresistible necessity. He would just make an appointment with her, and a
glance of the eye and a single word would suffice. He remembered his way
through the labyrinth of the shop; he knew that her department was on the
second floor. He walked through the place, which was crowded, as if he had as
good a right as any one else; and as he had entertained himself, on rising,
with putting on his holiday garments, in which he made such a distinguished
little figure, he was not suspected of any purpose more nefarious than that of
looking for some nice thing to give a lady. He ascended the stairs, and found
himself in a large room where made-up articles were exhibited and where, though
there were twenty people in it, a glance told him he shouldn&rsquo;t find
Millicent. She was perhaps in the next one, into which he passed by a wide
opening. Here also were numerous purchasers, most of them ladies; the men were
but three or four, and the disposal of the wares was in the hands of neat young
women attired in black dresses with long trains. At first it appeared to
Hyacinth that the young woman he sought was even here not within sight, and he
was turning away, to look elsewhere, when suddenly he perceived that a tall
gentleman, standing in the middle of the room, was none other than Captain
Sholto. It next became plain to him that the person standing upright before the
Captain, as still as a lay-figure and with her back turned to Hyacinth, was the
object of his own quest. In spite of her averted face he instantly recognised
Millicent; he knew her shop-attitude, the dressing of her hair behind, and the
long, grand lines of her figure, draped in the last new thing. She was
exhibiting this article to the Captain, and he was lost in contemplation. He
had been beforehand with Hyacinth as a false purchaser, but he imitated a real
one better than our young man, as, with his eyes travelling up and down the
front of Millicent&rsquo;s person, he frowned, consideringly, and rubbed his
lower lip slowly with his walking-stick. Millicent stood admirably still, and
the back-view of the garment she displayed was magnificent. Hyacinth, for a
minute, stood as still as she. At the end of that minute he perceived that
Sholto saw him, and for an instant he thought he was going to direct
Millicent&rsquo;s attention to him. But Sholto only looked at him very hard,
for a few seconds, without telling her he was there; to enjoy that satisfaction
he would wait till the interloper was gone. Hyacinth gazed back at him for the
same length of time&mdash;what these two pairs of eyes said to each other
requires perhaps no definite mention&mdash;and then turned away.
</p>

<p>
That evening, about nine o&rsquo;clock, the Princess Casamassima drove in a
hansom to Hyacinth&rsquo;s lodgings in Westminster. The door of the house was a
little open, and a man stood on the step, smoking his big pipe and looking up
and down. The Princess, seeing him while she was still at some distance, had
hoped he was Hyacinth, but he proved to be a very different figure indeed from
her devoted young friend. He had not a forbidding countenance, but he looked
very hard at her as she descended from her hansom and approached the door. She
was used to being looked at hard, and she didn&rsquo;t mind this; she supposed
he was one of the lodgers in the house. He edged away to let her pass, and
watched her while she endeavoured to impart an elasticity of movement to the
limp bell-pull beside the door. It gave no audible response, so that she said
to him, &ldquo;I wish to ask for Mr Hyacinth Robinson. Perhaps you can tell
me&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I too,&rdquo; the man replied, smiling. &ldquo;I have come also for
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated a moment. &ldquo;I think you must be Mr Schinkel. I have
heard of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know me by my bad English,&rdquo; her interlocutor remarked, with a
sort of benevolent coquetry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your English is remarkably good&mdash;I wish I spoke German as well.
Only just a hint of an accent, and evidently an excellent vocabulary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I have heard, also, of you,&rdquo; said Schinkel,
appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we know each other, in our circle, don&rsquo;t we? We are all
brothers and sisters.&rdquo; The Princess was anxious, she was in a fever; but
she could still relish the romance of standing in a species of back-slum and
fraternising with a personage looking like a very tame horse whose collar
galled him. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s at home, I hope; he is coming down to
you?&rdquo; she went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know. I am waiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have they gone to call him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Schinkel looked at her, while he puffed his pipe. &ldquo;I have called him
myself, but he will not say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;he will not say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His door is locked. I have knocked many times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he is out,&rdquo; said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he may be out,&rdquo; Schinkel remarked, judicially.
</p>

<p>
He and the Princess stood a moment looking at each other, and then she asked,
&ldquo;Have you any doubt of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>es kann sein</i>. Only the woman of the house told me five
minutes ago that he came in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, he probably went out again,&rdquo; the Princess remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but she didn&rsquo;t hear him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess reflected, and was conscious that she was flushing. She knew what
Schinkel knew about their young friend&rsquo;s actual situation, and she wished
to be very clear with him, and to induce him to be the same with her. She was
rather baffled, however, by the sense that he was cautious, and justly
cautious. He was polite and inscrutable, quite like some of the high
personages&mdash;ambassadors and cabinet-ministers&mdash;whom she used to meet
in the great world. &ldquo;Has the woman been here, in the house, ever
since?&rdquo; she asked in a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she went out for ten minutes, half an hour ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, then, he may have gone out again in that time!&rdquo; the
Princess exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is what I have thought. It is also why I have waited here,&rdquo;
said Schinkel. &ldquo;I have nothing to do,&rdquo; he added, serenely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neither have I,&rdquo; the Princess rejoined. &ldquo;We can wait
together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you haven&rsquo;t got some room,&rdquo; the German
suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed; this will do very well. We shall see him the sooner when he
comes back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but perhaps it won&rsquo;t be for long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that; I will wait. I hope you don&rsquo;t object
to my company,&rdquo; she went on, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is good, it is good,&rdquo; Schinkel responded, through his smoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I will send away my cab.&rdquo; She returned to the vehicle and
paid the driver, who said, &ldquo;Thank you, my lady,&rdquo; with expression,
and drove off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You gave him too much,&rdquo; observed Schinkel, when she came back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he looked like a nice man. I am sure he deserved it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is very expensive,&rdquo; Schinkel went on, sociably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and I have no money, but it&rsquo;s done. Was there no one else in
the house while the woman was away?&rdquo; the Princess asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, the people are out; she only has single men. I asked her that. She
has a daughter, but the daughter has gone to see her cousin. The mother went
only a hundred yards, round the corner there, to buy a pennyworth of milk. She
locked this door, and put the key in her pocket; she stayed at the
grocer&rsquo;s, where she got the milk, to have a little conversation with a
friend she met there. You know ladies always stop like that&mdash;<i>nicht
wahr?</i> It was half an hour later that I came. She told me that he was at
home, and I went up to his room. I got no sound, as I have told you. I came
down and spoke to her again, and she told me what I say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you determined to wait, as I have done,&rdquo; said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I want to see him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So do I, very much.&rdquo; The Princess said nothing more, for a minute;
then she added, &ldquo;I think we want to see him for the same reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Das kann sein&mdash;das kann sein</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two continued to stand there in the brown evening, and they had some
further conversation, of a desultory and irrelevant kind. At the end of ten
minutes the Princess broke out, in a low tone, laying her hand on her
companion&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;Mr Schinkel, this won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m
intolerably nervous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is the nature of ladies,&rdquo; the German replied,
imperturbably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish to go up to his room,&rdquo; the Princess pursued. &ldquo;You
will be so good as to show me where it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will do you no good, if he is not there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Princess hesitated. &ldquo;I am not sure he is not there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if he won&rsquo;t speak, it shows he likes better not to have
visitors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he may like to have me better than he does you!&rdquo; the Princess
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Das kann sein&mdash;das kann sein</i>.&rdquo; But Schinkel made no
movement to introduce her into the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing to-night&mdash;you know what I mean,&rdquo; the
Princess remarked, after looking at him a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the Duke&rsquo;s. The first party is on Thursday, the other is next
Tuesday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Schön</i>. I never go to parties,&rdquo; said Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Except that <i>this</i> is a kind of party&mdash;you and me,&rdquo;
suggested Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and the woman of the house doesn&rsquo;t approve of it.&rdquo; The
footstep of the personage in question had been audible in the passage, through
the open door, which was presently closed, from within, with a little
reprehensive bang. Something in this incident appeared to quicken exceedingly
the Princess&rsquo;s impatience and emotion; the menace of exclusion from the
house made her wish more even than before to enter it. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
sake, Mr Schinkel, take me up there. If you won&rsquo;t, I will go
alone,&rdquo; she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
Her face was white now, and it need hardly be added that it was beautiful. The
German considered it a moment in silence; then turned and reopened the door and
went in, followed closely by his companion.
</p>

<p>
There was a light in the lower region, which tempered the gloom of the
staircase&mdash;as high, that is, as the first floor; the ascent the rest of
the way was so dusky that the pair went slowly and Schinkel led the Princess by
the hand. She gave a suppressed exclamation as she rounded a sharp turn in the
second flight. &ldquo;Good God, is that his door, with the light?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you can see under it. There was a light before,&rdquo; said
Schinkel, without confusion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why, in heaven&rsquo;s name, didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I thought it would worry you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t it worry <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little, but I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Schinkel. &ldquo;Very
likely he may have left it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t leave candles!&rdquo; the Princess returned, with
vehemence. She hurried up the few remaining steps to the door, and paused there
with her ear against it. Her hand grasped the handle, and she turned it, but
the door resisted. Then she murmured, pantingly, to her companion, &ldquo;We
must go in&mdash;we must go in!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will you do, when it&rsquo;s locked?&rdquo; he inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must break it down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is very expensive,&rdquo; said Schinkel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be abject!&rdquo; cried the Princess. &ldquo;In a house like
this the fastenings are certainly flimsy; they will easily yield.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if he is not there&mdash;if he comes back and finds what we have
done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him a moment through the darkness, which was mitigated only by
the small glow proceeding from the chink. &ldquo;He <i>is</i> there! Before
God, he is there!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Schön, schön</i>,&rdquo; said her companion, as if he felt the
contagion of her own dread but was deliberating and meant to remain calm. The
Princess assured him that one or two vigorous thrusts with his shoulder would
burst the bolt&mdash;it was sure to be some wretched morsel of tin&mdash;and
she made way for him to come close. He did so, he even leaned against the door,
but he gave no violent push, and the Princess waited, with her hand against her
heart. Schinkel apparently was still deliberating. At last he gave a low sigh.
&ldquo;I know they found him the pistol; it is only for that,&rdquo; he
murmured; and the next moment Christina saw him sway sharply to and fro in the
gloom. She heard a crack and saw that the lock had yielded. The door collapsed:
they were in the light; they were in a small room, which looked full of things.
The light was that of a single candle on the mantel; it was so poor that for a
moment she made out nothing definite. Before that moment was over, however, her
eyes had attached themselves to the small bed. There was something on
it&mdash;something black, something ambiguous, something outstretched. Schinkel
held her back, but only for an instant; she saw everything, and with the very
act she flung herself beside the bed, upon her knees. Hyacinth lay there as if
he were asleep, but there was a horrible thing, a mess of blood, on the bed, in
his side, in his heart. His arm hung limp beside him, downwards, off the narrow
couch; his face was white and his eyes were closed. So much Schinkel saw, but
only for an instant; a convulsive movement of the Princess, bending over the
body while a strange low cry came from her lips, covered it up. He looked about
him for the weapon, for the pistol, but the Princess, in her rush at the bed,
had pushed it out of sight with her knees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity they found
it&mdash;if he hadn&rsquo;t had it here!&rdquo; he exclaimed to her. He had
determined to remain calm, so that, on turning round at the quick advent of the
little woman of the house, who had hurried up, white, scared, staring, at the
sound of the crashing door, he was able to say, very quietly and gravely,
&ldquo;Mr Robinson has shot himself through the heart. He must have done it
while you were fetching the milk.&rdquo; The Princess got up, hearing another
person in the room, and then Schinkel perceived the small revolver lying just
under the bed. He picked it up and carefully placed it on the mantel-shelf,
keeping, equally carefully, to himself the reflection that it would certainly
have served much better for the Duke.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
